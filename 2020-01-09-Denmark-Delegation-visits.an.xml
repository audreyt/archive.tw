                        Yeah. Thanks for seeing us, Minister. We are here. My name is Jonas Parello-Plesner. I head something called the Alliance for Democracy Foundation in Copenhagen that was founded by the former NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish Prime Minister, which works to strengthen cooperation among democracies.

                        We have a strong focus also on election interference following the 2016 election in the US. It’s been a lot on Russia but there are definitely other actors that are good at disinformation and election interference as well.

                        One of my main reasons for coming to Taiwan is actually for the elections, bolster support for your democracy but then also to discuss what you see of disinformation and what has been the countermeasures also in strengthening resilience, which is something would be very interesting to hear your point of view on.

                        Also, because it seems to be a big part of your mission of digital democracy of strengthening people’s participation in that way. That would be one thing, and then I’ll let the rest of the delegation also present themselves.

                        Of course, my focus is more on the what we call traditional security, the geopolitics of it, but of course these things place into it as well, especially and when you talk cross-strait relations.

                        Hello, my name’s Lukas Lausen. I currently work as a political advisor in the Danish industry. Before that, I worked in the European Parliament as a political advisor on foreign policy, amongst other things, to a member of the Parliament who’s now the foreign minister of Denmark.

                        I’m also the chairman of the Danish Foreign Policy Society, under 35. In terms of issues that I’d love to discuss, most of it has been mentioned. Generally, what interests me is the foreign interference, in general, that you’re expecting or have been working with during the election and experiencing over especially the last few years.

                        Let me just, in very broad brushes, give you some thoughts about my current role in the administration, wearing my digital minister hat. [laughs] Then I have some personal observations that is less related to my role. You visited the g0v movement, and they keep transcripts, as we do. I already read your exchange. [laughs]

                    <p>
                        There’s several points that I would like to make, knowing that you already understood the civil society, social innovator’s point of view. The first thing here is let’s start with this NetzDG. Indeed, NetzDG has shaped the policy discussion around the world, and Taiwan is no exception.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Back when I became digital minister, we specifically looked at the issue of online content moderation. At that time, it was early 2017, and then I brought this three point in the cabinet meeting back then that it needs our rapid response.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It need to be open, meaning that we must allow remixes and memetic engineering based on our content, so open in the sense of open communication, but also as in open license. We must be swift, as in responding within two hours whenever there is a piece of disinformation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It need to be structured, structured meaning that we need to communicate in a very methodological fashion, targeting the media that are mostly live-streamed on the phone, media that is mostly visual on the tablet or a computer, media that is more traditional and that needs a full story and things like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is to say, we need to be responding in a multimodal way so that wherever the disinformation took in its modality, we meet them there with the same modality. That was the principles.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Then NetzDG appeared, and then people started turning the conversation on, “How much should we place the governor, the new governor of the Internet, which is Facebook and friends, into a co-governing position?”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        “How much accountability, how much transparency, how much duty of regulation can we put on their side?” which is, I think, the main idea of NetzDG, which many jurisdictions, although they cited NetzDG, they didn’t quite take that co-governor role.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I wouldn’t name names, but it seems like a certain jurisdiction took the role of traditional censorship, which is like a minister’s words can force a journalist change their title or something like that. Which is, again, not treating the new social media as co-governors, but rather is a more “cyber-sovereignty, vertical point of view.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is less interesting in Taiwan because everybody know it’s impossible. [laughs] Taiwan is, as a matter of fact, the only country in Asia and one of the only two in Asia-Pacific that’s rated by the CIVICUS Monitor as fully open, meaning that a journalist’s word is always as good as a minister’s.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There is no encroachment of freedom of speech, assembly, press, and so on. Because that’s defining characteristics of Taiwanese democracy, it’s inconceivable for us to choose the short-cut, so to speak, which is more censorship and more power in the administration.

                        Much as what they have done and I personally have done during the spam wars about 20 years ago, where people voluntarily donate their junk mails into a spam house and sharing the fingerprints of spammers into the mail provider’s, so that whenever the spammers try to send another email, it lands to your junk mailbox instead of your inbox.

                        That did not take a law. There is no law about spamming in Taiwan. It took a collaboration between five different stakeholder groups all agreeing to work together. Our core idea to the local social media companies is that this is by far what we prefer.

                        One very quick example before the next round – we say that we have the norm, for example, that all political campaign donations and spendings are published in raw data form, analyzable by machines, by a separate branch of government called the Control Yuan.

                    <p>
                        This is the norm here, so that the investigative journalist can look at the previous election’s campaign donation results and find out which one’s donations did not actually go through campaign donation but rather they would go directly to social media advertisement, for example, and then on towards data.

                    <p>
                        We then say to the different social media companies, at least of five, that has signed on the norm package sign, “This is the norm here. You either treat the political advertisements as campaign donation, meaning you published a raw data and keep it for after date election for independent analysis, or you ban them altogether.”

                        There really is no law enforcing this but a risk of social sanction. Basically, make sure that all the global multimedia companies, social media companies, either declared that they are conforming to the Control Yuan standard, which is what Facebook did this time, or releasing its open data or they stop running political advertisements altogether during election now, which is what Google and Twitter did.

                        Comparing across the board, you can easily see what looks like an underreport or overreport or whatever by individual campaign supporters. That is actually part of the basis of social sanction. This is, for example, if you look at g0v-launched vote.ly.g0v.tw website, that is what they show very quickly and here I choose some random – well not so random – legislator candidates. Then…

                        Now, if you use Uber in Taiwan, you always find a legal taxi driver, but then the legal taxi driver has been far expanded. They no longer drive the yellow cars because they’re not hailing on the street and so on. That is basically something nobody can say, “I’m perfectly fine with it,” but everybody say, “I can live with it.” That is the idea of rough consensus.

                        We take this very seriously, because we believe only when the children learn that they are data producers, they are media producers, that they are producers, can try truly understand what framing effect or whatever other effects are, and be journalistically a contributor to collaborative fact-checking? Which I think is the real way to counter disinformation.

                        The SARS clause, the epidemic disinformation clause, along with the one around election interference, that are like the two more prominent in people’s minds. I would say it is the social norm to say that just as you cannot scream very loudly in a market about, like, “SARS is coming and people who stay here will be infected.”

In other words, if I’m someone who spreads a rumor that is liable to affect your election then, and I do it with the purpose to harm your election process, then that is a criminal sanction.

                        Actually, in Taiwan, there is quite a few observations around the antiELAB, because antiELAB has a leaderless structure. The people who work to discredit antiELAB also has to innovate, because previously, it’s about discredited one or two leaders.

                        The structure of this is interesting because it didn’t accuse any perpetrator. This is basically saying that they allegedly interviewed a few people who are 13 years old or 14 years old, and they got new iPhones or whatever for murdering or violently attacking the police.

                        The initial re-framing was actually done in the public onin the Weibo of Zhongyang Zhengfawei. What I’m trying to say is that we thought of disinformation manipulation, it’s mostly a covert thing. That’s why the content farms, the bots, or whatever. But this is overt. They sign their name on it, encouraging remixes and things like that. I think they’re also innovating.

                        This is new. Previously, it has an extremely high threshold. People, by refraining from partaking in referenda, can fizzle any referenda. That is the 2003 version, which is why you didn’t know much about it. I didn’t know about that either. It’s not very much used.

                    <p>
                        However, the new version, which is the 2019 version, is now every two years. At the fourth Saturday of each August, we have a referenda. It’s called by anyone who can manage to convince the total electing citizens number, at 0.5 percent, to counter-signature.

                        Then you raise a referendum topic. This is by simple majority. People will no longer be incentivized to refrain from casting vote by saying no. If they don’t show up, their side actually lose. Then it’s binding only for two years.

                        It’s a referendum every two years, so every time, the referendum can turn over the previous referendum’s topic because every referendum is binding only for two years anyway. This is a new design. It’s a interesting design.

                        You can vote only if you’re 20 years old, but you can partake in referenda if you’re 18 years old, so two different systems now, on alternating years.

                        Your personal view on how do you see this compared to – I love the expression – crowd law? This is a new way of doing it. It seems also very classical. You have it in the US, and then you have these odd referendum that are put sometimes on the ballot.

                        Exactly. Like Brexit, it’s binary. Either you’re in or you’re out, but you don’t really know what does it mean until you…

                    <p>
                        If you’re binding only for two years, another way to think about it is that this is a sandbox. You can try something out for two years and see what happens, which brings it more at the define stage if you’re looking at this this way.

                        Brexit would definitely be even after this stage because it forecloses other possibilities of development. [laughs] Our referendums doesn’t have this character because, after two years, people can decide to try something else instead. It depends.

                        I don’t have a real theory. My anecdotal hypothesis is that these two groups have more time on their hands.

                        A lot of the most impactful petitions, for example, one that calls for banning of plastic straws, which took effect last year, and many impactful ones are done by people who are around 15 or 16 years old. They cannot even initiate a referenda. There really is no other institutional way for they to partake in democracy. Of course, they do that a lot.

Underlying cybersecurity system, called Sandstorm, is audited and, indeed, penetration tested in the white-box fashion by people who participate in the top DEFCON CTF, actually second-place winners in 2019, for half a year before we deploy this.

                        In Taiwan, this basically forces the environmental minister to come out, and because we can’t beat them, we must join them. They must negotiate.

                        They negotiated with the civic tech community who say by collective bargaining we allow the environment minister to join in our calibration of our numbers and join our distributor ledger, which is an immutable record of air quality, because at the time, the EPA only have 87 stations.

                        No match to the more than 2,000 stations from the civil society. The civil society say, by allowing the EPA to join the civil IoT system, we ask something in return. We want air measurement devices in those industrial parks. These are private property. We can’t break and enter and install them.

                        It turns out we own the lamps in the industrial parks. We use their spec, their AirBox designs, joining their network to form data collaboratives. Basically, I think almost half of these are primary school. They use this as a way to teach data governance, data producers’ ethics, and so on, data competence to the high schoolers.

                        They think that whatever AI algorithm they can develop to predict air quality or whatever, they can upload to the civil IoT system, the world’s, I think, 20th-fastest supercomputer, to just analyze this together.

                        Data collaboratives, I really think, is what sets Taiwan apart, not just from the PRC, but from anywhere that doesn’t have the absolute freedom of speech that make the social sector gaining legitimacy in an unprecedented way, vis-Ã -vis the public sector.

                        Thanks a lot for this meeting. I knew this was going to be exciting when I had asked to see, but you completely surpassed all the expectations. Everything you do, I think for all of us as well, that are used to seeing ourselves as Danes, that come from the number one on happiness and on many other indicators.
