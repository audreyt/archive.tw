                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        Good morning and welcome to the FCCJ. Thank you, those who’ve come to the club and also those watching online. My name’s Andy Sharp. I work at the “Nikkei Asian Review.” Today, we have a very special guest.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        It’s Audrey Tang. She’s Taiwan’s Digital Minister, a 39-year-old former hacker with a reported very high IQ, who at the age of 14 co-founded a computer book publisher and developed a search engine. She went on to become a Silicon Valley consultant for the likes of Apple.

                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        Audrey Tang was invited into President Tsai Ing-wen’s cabinet in 2016 to help boost Taiwan’s digital prowess. She’s gone on to help lead the country’s much-applauded fight against the coronavirus by helping develop apps to spread the distribution of masks and economic stimulus coupons.

                    <p>
                        There’s much to discuss. Clearly, China tech is a big issue here. In a recent interview with my colleagues at the Nikkei in Taipei, she said that allowing Chinese equipment into a country’s core telecom infrastructure is like inviting a Trojan horse into the network.

                    <p>
                        Anyway, without further ado, I believe Miss Tang’s going to make a short speech. We have a bunch of questions already received online. We’ll also take questions from the room. Just to introduce myself, by the way, I am the moderator. This is Teddy Jimbo. He’s the FCCJ PAC co-chair.

                    <p>
                        Hello. My extremely short speech, about 30 seconds long…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        …is just to introduce the Slido system that we’re going to use for this live Q&#x26;A. I see there’s already seven questions being asked. Very quickly, I think they will project the Slido link on the screen. If the tech is still being worked on, you can also manually go to slido.com – that’s S-L-I-D-O.com – and enter this code. The code is 00727.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s by scanning the QR code, hopefully to be projected soon, or by going to slido.com and enter 00727, you can like each other’s questions. The question with the most number of likes will float to the top. I will answer that first.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        [laughs]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If we get all the questions, that’s great. At any given time, of course you can ask me a question which will appear on the bottom right of the projection screen.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If I cannot get to all the questions by the end of the hour, sorry about that, but if people have anything to ask from the podium, actually I don’t see the camera of the person, people on site, so the moderator will have to interrupt me during my answer to the online questions so that we can get a good online-offline mix. That’s my opening presentation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        Thank you very much. Do you want to start by answering some of the questions that’s been sent so far on Slido?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right. The top one, currently from – sorry if my pronunciation is not perfect – from Ilgin Yorulmaz from BBC World Turkish. The question was, what would I advise other governments in how to deal with social media companies when it comes to balancing citizens’ privacy while maintaining free speech?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We believe, in Taiwan, that free speech is a core value. It’s not an instrumental value. Indeed, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, we’re the only jurisdiction in Asia which allows the completely open freedom of speech, assembly, the press, and so on, and if you count New Zealand, that’s one of the only two in Asia Pacific.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In our norm, it’s not about takedown. We don’t believe in takedown. We believe that a journalist’s word should always worth the same as a minister’s word, actually more.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The point is not allowing the administration to collaborate with social media companies to take down anything, but to rather work out a way for people who see disinformation, as defined as intentional untruth to do public harm, the antithesis of journalism, people can flag it very easily.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For example, I’ll use a metaphor, maybe you’ve noticed that in your email inbox, if you receive a email saying that, I don’t know, they’re a royalty, they have like 10,000 Bitcoins, and they want to wire you if you just pay this small deposit and so on. It’s a scam, by the way, and so you would probably flag it as spam. That is the norm in the Internet governance.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Basically, email is supposed to be private, but if you flag something as spam, you donate the signature, the fingerprint of that email so that people who receive similar email in the future, they still receive the email, but it goes to the spam mail, the junk mail folder rather than the inbox.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is to say, it doesn’t pay to send spam after a sufficient number have flagged it because it stops wasting people’s time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Similarly, when people flag things on the, for example, LINE, which is end-to-end encryption channel, as scam or spam, it get sent to the International Fact-Checking Network members.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In Taiwan, there’s two, the MyGoPen and in the Taiwan FactChecking Center, and they make sure that they flag things as scam or as disinformation a soon as possible.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The role of the government is just to make sure that once we detect that there is such a trending disinformation, not only do we, with journalists, so that they can do a public attribution so that people understand it is actually not true when they see it online or on the Facebook Media and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We also roll out counter-messages that are true up to what we understand, and then package in a very funny way. This is what we call humor over rumor because a lot of conspiracy theory travel on outrage, and if we publish something that is very funny, literally a person cannot simultaneously feel joy and outrage about the same thing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because of that, people who have seen for example our premier wiggling his butt, saying that there’s no need to panic-buy tissue papers because we only have one pair of butt each, and by the way, tissue papers are of a different material than medical mask, so ramping up medical masks doesn’t hurt tissue paper production.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s very funny and has a higher R value than the original conspiracy theory.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is the idea of humor over rumor and partnering with journalists and fact-checking organizations. The social media companies basically conform to this norm by doing notice and public notice.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        Thank you. Maybe we can go on to the next question from, on your list, from Peele?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

                        Peele, from Italy?

                <speech by="#Andy Sharp">
                    <p>
                        Yes.

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The question is, do I think the world can survive without Chinese technology? I think Peele doesn’t mean paper, but rather Huawei.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        In Taiwan, as actually the moderator have already mentioned, during the Sunflower Movement in 2014, there’s half a million people on the street, many more online deliberating each and every aspect of the Cross-Strait Service and Trade Agreement, or CSSTA. One of the aspects was this very issue.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s not about any particular company, though. The issue was about whether we want to allow PRC components in our then new 4G infrastructure. The consensus on the street, later ratified by the National Communication Commission and National Security Council, is no.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The reason is not that they’re inferior or that they necessarily come with malaise or whatever, but rather with the realization that there is no private sector organization in the PRC. When the need comes, the state can always make it de facto state-owned by searching and replacing leadership.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Basically, that says each time we upgrade, even though the previous version that we installed have passed cyber security scrutiny, we will have to do that over again.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There is no telling whether there are state-owned or de facto state-owned actors trying to, via these upgrades, to install new backdoors into the system, and so the total cost of ownership of maintenance is deemed too high compared to other vendors.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because of that, starting from 4G, that’s 2014, we did not use any PRC components in the core infrastructure, and what little there were, I think were all replaced by 2016.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Obviously we’ve survived not only the pandemic and infodemic, but we have pretty good 5G connection. I’m holding a 5G phone, using, this is LG technology, I think, as we speak, and so obviously we’re doing fine, not only surviving but thriving.

                        Thank you. I’m going to open this to the room as well, if there are any questions, so please raise your hands if you have anything, but let me ask one question first.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s a question sent by email from Peter Elstrom at Bloomberg News. He asks, do you think there’s a justification for governments around the world to tighten controls or ban social media apps such as TikTok and WeChat, and are there specific security risks that those apps pose to users?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, in Taiwan, we make a distinction between the social sanction, which is a very strong power. For example, Facebook, during our election in 2018, the mayoral election, because our control branch, that’s a separate branch of the government, published for the first time the raw data of campaign donation and expense.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People independently discovered, by people, I mean investigative journalists, independently discovered that there’s a large swath of campaign donation expense that’s not filed to the control branch. These are social media advertisements, precision targeted advertisements.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course, Facebook at that time, there was no disclosure of the kind of the control branch, the radical transparency that we did, and so there’s a social backlash.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People were saying that Facebook, by not disclosing it to the Control Yuan standards, is hurting the democracy by allowing extrajudicial donations to the campaign sponsorships to the campaigns, and that has a detrimental effect on the democracy.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

                        Because of that, the Control Yuan norms, which is two, first, only domestic citizens get to donate, and second, each and every raw expense item is published, we basically had a public conversation around it, the transcript of which is online, with all the social media companies.

                        We agreed on a norm on a counter-disinformation self-regulation principle. The implicit outside game is always of course that if Facebook doesn’t publish its advertisements libraries to the same degree or more as compared to the Control Yuan.

                        Even though that we may not have the legal instruments to shut down Facebook or to dispel Facebook, people would view that Facebook is actively working against our democracy, and so we’ll boycott Facebook. That’s what I call social sanction.

                        I think, for questions like this, instead of saying like we should outright ban it or that we should allow it, getting a social norm, a social outrage if you will, about the kind of threat that it could have on democracy and negotiating a safe norm and so making sure that international companies conform to that norm in a auditable, accountable fashion, that is preferred.

Is there any digital gap between generations in Taiwan? My second question is, do elderly people have difficulty accepting the digitization of the society in Taiwan?

                        Thank you. There’s just a, I think, a NPR and “New York Times,” piece about how a Taiwanese couple in their 80s becomes Instagram’s newest fashion influencers. They own a laundry shop in Central Taiwan, and became Instagram stars by posing as models the laundries that their customers never picked up, and so they run a very successful Instagram campaign.

                            (laughs) The point I'm trying to make is that this is a lifelong learning process. This is not necessarily that the older people are not digitally competent. It's just that if we shape the conversations so that we encourage everybody to learn.

                        The technologies in Taiwan basically says that we need to adapt to the societal needs. It’s not asking a certain population to come to technology. Rather, it is us, the technologists, conforming to what the societal expectation, societal norms of technologies are.

                        Thank you. Take another question here online. It’s from Anthony Rowley at the “SCMP.” As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you said in the “Nikkei” interview that allowing Chinese equipment into a country’s infrastructure is like inviting a Trojan horse in. Why do you think this, and how exactly does this work?

                        Yeah, and I was simply relaying the rough consensus of the 2014 occupiers, so it’s not my view. It’s what the occupiers feel at the time, and then ratified by the National Security Council and National Communication Commission. How does that work?

                        If you install certain components, no matter whether it’s software or hardware, of course you do a security audit, but then necessarily, either in a emergency situation, for example when it’s out of service or whether there’s just a security vulnerability that’s discovered and disclosed, you will probably have to update that piece of software and firmware, and even hardware, from the vendor.

                        The main idea around Occupy in 2014 was that we never know at which point would the CCP, through its party branches, install in all the large so-called privately owned enterprises did do a swap of the leadership and take de facto control of the private enterprise, so that they become de facto state-owned.

                        Every time you operate, you have to do another systemic risk assessment, which could be done. The feeling at the time is that the risk is too high and the protocols of ownership too high. We would be better to work with other vendors from liberal democratic countries.

                        I think there’s two things. The first is that we are already seeing companies that strive only free speech. For example, media companies, the journalism workers, they are already setting up their headquarters in Taiwan and either moving from Hong Kong or moving from PRC to Taiwan.

                        The people who hold, for example, the Oslo Freedom Forum choose Taiwan as their base. Indeed, the Reporters Without Borders, Reporters sans frontièrs, choose Taiwan as their regional headquarter.

                    <p>
                        All of this, of course, is recognizing the fact that in Taiwan a journalist’s word is worth at least the same, or if not more, compare to a minister’s words. You will not get “harmonized” or “disappear” if you say something that hurts the image of a minister. That’s just good journalism.

                        I think anything that thrives on free speech, anything that thrives on what we call a permissionless innovation, including many more interesting fintech, including DeFi, distributed finance companies, and so on, they necessarily think that Taiwan is a better place, even though that their innovations may not be restrained to Taiwan only.

                        It did not really interfere the presidential election, although there’s a lot of disinformation campaigns, which are not strictly speaking cyber attacks in the traditional cybersecurity sense. There were specifically around the anti-ELAB protests in Hong Kong.

                        They even use a Reuters photo. The Reuters photo, the caption initially said nothing of that sort. They just swapped a different caption saying that this certain-years-old bought new iPhones, because they went on the street getting paid, like mercenaries and things like that.

                        Of course, the way to debunk those is very simply encourage YouTubers to record – and live stream, even – the counting process, because we are using paper ballot. We use the counting process, inviting journalists to film from all the different sides.

                        If there is invisible ink, I’m sure that it will get discovered and so on and so forth. There’s a lot of overt work on disinformation, but I think it’s proved to be much less impactful in the presidential election, compared to the mayor election, partly because the social media agreed on the counter-disinformation norms.

                        There’s a saying, “Anything that’s in-place when I’m born is human nature, and anything that’s introduced after I’m born is called technology.” So, in Taiwan, democracy’s a technology.

                        Paraphrasing that, we could say that any measure that’s already taken by the state before the pandemic is considered norm, and any measure that’s introduced only after the pandemic would be considered novel.

                        In Taiwan, for example, the digital fence relied on a system that’s already in-place and that advanced earthquake and flood warnings so that people in certain regions will receive an automated cell broadcast or an SMS seconds before a major earthquake happening, or that if they’re in a vulnerable place, a flood, when there’s a typhoon or a heavy rain.

                        Indeed, last night, I just received one because of the earthquake, giving me plenty of time. By plenty, I mean maybe a few seconds, to find someplace solid. Because that’s already in-place, this geofenced SMS delivery is already in-place.

                        When we repurpose that so that people who return to Taiwan can choose either to go to a quarantine hotel for 14 days, or if you decide to stay home, if they have a bathroom of their own and they don’t live with people in the vulnerable groups, they can choose to place their phone instead under quarantine.

                        That is the digital fence. Whenever the phone escapes the roughly 50-meter radius – it’s not GPS, it’s just cellphone tower broadcasting triangulation – just like receiving an SMS of earthquake warning, their phone and the nearly household managers, as well police, will receive such an SMS.

                        They will check their whereabouts. Because of that, the system is already quite well-understood before the pandemic. When we repurpose that, people feel that it is a narrow, deep intrusion to their privacy, but it’s clearly time-limited.

                        In Taiwan, we see the digitalization project not as one letter, but as four letters. It’s very easy to remember. The four letters are called digitization, innovation, governance, and inclusion.

                        If we can empower all the citizens of software to become co-creators, rather than just users, who often connote a very addictive way of relationship to technology – there are some other industry that also use the term “users” – we need to rethink the relationship of software-making and people who use the software.

When we see machine learning, let’s make it collaborative learning. When we see user experience, let’s make it about human experience.

                        Thank you. We’ve got a question here following up on the Internet of Things. It’s again from Anthony Rowley at the SCMP. “Has 5G made it easier to access the Internet of Things from outside, granting others access to vital control systems?”

                        Not necessarily, because the information flow can be configured in various different ways. For example, in Taiwan, there’s a lot of people voluntarily putting AirBoxes – that is, very cheap, less than $100 – PM2.5 and other air quality detectors on their balconies, on the primary schools to teach kids digital competence.

                        So that they become data producers, data stewards, rather than just consumers of data. That is, of course, a great educational tool, but it also enabled us to have a very complete structure of moving this to other, for example, water pollution sensing and mask availability level and so on.

                        It enables the entire community, the entire society, to collaboratively do sense-making about things. It relies on the ideas of a distributed ledger that everybody can just write to, append to, without taking control of anybody else’s numbers.

                        If you configure it this way, then there is no risk of people interfering with the control systems of the larger, for example, environmental sensors or the industrial processes, and so on. People just write to this distributed ledger, and the use of that ledger is governed by its own logic, according to each and every collaborator in the data collaborative.

                        There are ways to design the data flow such that this concerns is minimized. It’s very important to look at into the 5G specification and see where do we want to place the computing? Is it at the edge? Is it at the datacenters? Is there something in-between?

                        Thank you. Another question here from Mishimoto from the “Asahi Shimbun,” a Japanese newspaper. “You’re communicating, obviously now, through the world online. How, to you, does online communication compare with face-to-face communication? What is the advantage of online, and what is the advantage of face-to-face?”

                    <p>
                        The advantage of online is twofold. First, that we can see each other more clearly without wearing a medical mask, nowadays. The second thing is that it reduces carbon footprint. Also very important.

                        Speaking personally, because I adjust to jetlag very slowly, it also is much better than long-distance flight. On average, it takes me one day or more to adjust for one hour of jetlag difference. That’s just selfish reason. The other two are public benefit.

                        In any case, [laughs] the point I’m making is that mostly we can replace the knowledge-sharing part of face-to-face gatherings using online conference, as we’re having now, or even in virtual reality, where we can share knowledge about three-dimensional spatial objects, buildings, simulations, and things like that.

                        I even had a conversation with people in the primary and secondary schools by shrinking my own avatar in virtual reality to the same height at the kids. That really made them much more eager to interact with me, because I don’t look a meter and 80 centimeters high anymore.

                        These are the great thing about online, is that you can transcend the physical and acoustic rules. Of course, there’s parts of face-to-face that are not replaceable. For example, the face-to-face conversations that is around understanding what people feels like is very important.

                        In face-to-face conversations, we often make, for example, food, drinks, music, and things like that. Making sure that we can feel that we are not only in the same place, talking about the same things, but feeling the same.

                        That is harder to replicate in the online way, although I guess we can order the same pizza delivery beforehand and have the same beer or something. It could, of course, be arranged and approximated, but it’s not as natural as people gathering in the same face-to-face place.

                        In Taiwan, because we never had a lockdown, what we have seen is that people avoid large gatherings during the pandemic. We see education facilities encourage some kind of satellite structure, where people gather in preferably outdoor place, keeping one-meter distance, so we don’t have to wear a mask.

                        Having food, enjoying drink together, and using large projectors or virtual reality to connect to many more such places, so you can have the best of both worlds. Indeed, I’m working in the park in the Social Innovation Lab.

                        For example, there’s a young boy whose family called saying that “My boy doesn’t want to go to school because you only ration pink medical mask to our district. We don’t have other color of mask and our boy said that he will be bullied.”

                        The very next day, in the daily press conference, all the medical officers started wearing pink. The Minister of Health and Welfare said Pink Panther was his childhood hero, in a way of gender mainstreaming, I’m sure. Suddenly, the boy is the most hip person because only he has the color that the heroes are wearing.

                        The point of this daily, rather than every four years, iteration is that the social sector can bond together. Instead of just criticizing, they can offer constructive ways, alternative visions, forking the government and merge on a daily cycle just as in open source development.

                        If you have a short enough iteration, then the threats that unfold over long periods will get the collective intelligence sensing it long before it actually become a large problem. For example, when Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower from Wuhan, posted that there are “seven new SARS cases” in a local seafood market, within 24 hours it gets reposted to PTT, the local equivalent of Reddit here.

                        It gets upvoted, so our medical officers take that in for action. Imagine what would happen if it would take us a or so [laughs] to notice that post. That would have been impossible.

                    <p>
                        The way Dr. Li Wenliang became literally a savior of Taiwanese population is having a collective intelligence mechanism and have a really short iteration cycle from noticing it into sense-making, into triaging, into starting health inspections for all flights coming in from Wuhan to Taiwan the very next day, the first day of January of this year.

                        Short iterations, quick merging of alternative vision from the civil society, a strong and robust social sector, I think these are the ways that democracies can effectively deal with threats that are advanced and persistent.

                        This whole point of making sure that people can remix those messages into a way that’s calm, collected, and even humorous is very important to make sure that people don’t panic. Once they don’t panic, they have some mental capacity to understand some epidemiology and working with people who are closest to the suffering. I will use one example.

                        In Taiwan, there was a day when there was a confirmed case, and the confirmed case, she said that she stayed at home with no contact to people, a very simple family and so on. There’s no way that she would get infected by the COVID.

                        The medical officers keep on interviewing, and the next day, we discovered that she works in a kind of intimate bar and as a professional service provider in that intimate bar. She initially provided a different account because she didn’t want to reveal the people that she had intimate encounters with in that intimate bar as a professional.

                        They’re not criminals. They’re professionals, and we’re not threatening them even with the closure fines. We’re challenging them to discover ways that they can continue their business while observing physical distancing and real contact. That is to say, people have to find other way to contact them if there is really a virus outbreak.

                        At the time, it was met with some ridicule because people thought the entire point of intimate bars is to break the physical, and there really is no way [laughs] that people would consent of leaving their real contact details to the intimate bars. This is like the Pygmalion effect. If you expect the civil society to come up with innovations, eventually they do.

                        If you keep only on paper your contact phone number but under a pseudonym and if you physically shred that that paper after four weeks of no local outbreak, then people actually trust them enough to actually leave their contact details. You can do a SMS or LINE to check that it’s actually their number before they enter.

                        They eventually rose up to the challenge and become part of our conversation about the counter-coronavirus pandemic. Instead of casting any group as outsiders, it’s important to work with each and every group. Even though they’re currently not capable of coming up with physical distancing rules and so on, the belief is that they eventually would.

                        Once they do, the municipalities eventually require them to say which rules they’re implementing. Based on that accountability, then they’re allowed to reopen. That’s just one of a lot of examples in the Taiwanese counter-coronavirus effort. I hope this conveys the idea of co-creation.
