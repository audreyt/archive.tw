          <p>How’s everything going?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Pretty good. How’s it going for you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Not bad, pretty busy. But it’s kind of interesting, because right now we’re in an interesting position to see where we go from here.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>With the data?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Especially with the data. The application tool, I think we still need to do some pushing and promotion for this. Ultimately, I think we have to get our names out, and we have to have established credibility.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Ultimately, the tool works. We think maybe hitting accelerators and incubators, helping them with the human resource part of it of getting this visa would help, once you start building from there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Accelerate it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>[laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Yes, accelerators accelerates. We accelerate the process to our accelerators, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>How many people have...?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>For now, we have just one on our valley, but we are still preparing for the next phase. I don’t think right now we’re promoting, because the beta phase is very, very fundamental. It’s just stories, service providers, and then the tool.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>This is actually why Didi is working with us as a consultant. She is of former...can I post that? OK, sorry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>For sure, good point. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>She is a former global marketing director for Gogoro. She did some awesome things, let’s just say. I think Gogoro owes a lot to what she’s been doing. She has been helping us with the consulting part of this, with a lot of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We can also tailor make features as needed by large organizations. It’s a classic, you’re switching from a 2C to a 2B model, and of course, you need a few early adopters, but you can tailor make solutions for them all the same.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We package it more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>At the second...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>If you’re purely looking for business set-up from A to Z, we find you a local guide who can help you navigate the bank account systems. Another one, an easy immigration consulting, accountant, legal, if it’s all one package, then we can also give them some interesting deals.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Then we can also have another deal where it’s not just business consulting, but also helping you lifestyle-wise or educational resources, exactly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>You can even white label their whole website [laughs] for a large, multinational company. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Seriously. That might be interesting ways of going forward with this. Actually, I wanted to give you an update, because ASVDA’s like, &quot;OK, if we can establish this, this would also help us set out a lot, give us the access to resources.&quot; Especially, they can also explore Southeast Asia markets with the same model, too. We’ll see where we go from there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s awesome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We came here today, of course, to give you an update, because you’ve been so kind to supporting and everything. It’s always a pleasure chatting with you. Because we also do need to some fundraising, I know you had an idea last time about the milestone. It was a pay...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>I keep forgetting the term.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Pay for priority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Pay for priority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Justin Wu">
          <p>Pay for priority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s a more gentle way to say, &quot;White labeling.&quot;</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>White labeling, yes. There you go. Pay for their priority. We’re paying for the priority. We’re seeing, how, if anything, I know you can’t, as a public official, you have your lines. Is there any type of guidance you could provide, because we are at this pivotal stage. Our costs keep increasing, because we have to keep growing this beta stage, beta phase.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Core funds are no longer enough to sustain this entire project. As we are opening up new functions, opening up the Chinese version of our site, we’re also going to have to have new people for that. Any guidance you can provide on that end, people who might be interested in where we’re going with this platform?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Sure. The first thing still is broaden visibility in the ex-pat community. I’m sure you...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We’re starting that process.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think that’s something that can’t be skipped over, because after all, for an agency and a cross-functional agency as you are, trust is paramount. People need to trust that you’re not going away next week [laughs] before they hand out their services to you for a value-adding or for matchmaking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Just some general confidence that you won’t go away next week. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We’re going to be, &quot;Bye.&quot;</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>[laughs] Exactly. Also, I think it’s very good to have a ministry, news lens, or a media outlet visibility and outreach program as well, because that reduces your ongoing maintenance cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>All your system are indeed at this moment, it is actually one time. You can say, &quot;We’ve got additional funding. This is what we’re going to end up with, and then we’re going to partner with media partners, with what we have.&quot;</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If you want to say more, you’ve got to finance new investors or new patrons.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Right. I think we’re still at that very tip where we came out with the beta. It doesn’t exactly show where we’re going with it yet, it’s the very fundamental, and it’s more for our development idea about where we can take this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Ultimately, we just have to establish ourselves’ name amongst the foreigner community. From there, hopefully we can also start cultivating our Chinese readers to understand where this platform is going and what the direction is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>I think it’s a slow process. We’re also tapping up chambers of commerces, AmCham, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. We actually just met a representative to see whether there might be alignment in what we’re doing, if there can be some win-win opportunities along those lines.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Any other types of guidance or any types of things, thoughts, or ideas so far?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I would like to get your view on this endeavor. What are your take on this positioning of this endeavor?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Of the entire...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, the Crossroads.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>I agree with you. I think the trust needs to be established. there needs to be a few more testimonials, maybe even a working model that you can tell that story. I know you’re in beta right now, so it’s just trying to make sure it works before we flood it with traffic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>You’ve done a good job keeping some of those connections. I think there needs to be a few stories to be told that it’s possible. Even myself going through the tool, seeing all the parameters and stipulations that you need to have as an entrepreneur here, it looks pretty impossible to even get one of these things through.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>What’s that story we can tell to say it’s possible?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>It’s possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Does that means that we need to work with the government more closely to ensure that some of these things are being passed through? I think the tool’s a great idea. The branding is a great idea, as long as it’s validated and there’s testimonials. But, I think it remains to be seen if it’s actually going to be a possibility to get.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>You can’t pass the visa, you just have the...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We’re just here to lead them to the door.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>...the tunnel to the...Yeah, exactly. That would be my biggest gray area right now. As someone who’s potentially considering starting a consultancy, an agency, or something like that, or I have funds for doing so, I think it still looks pretty impossible. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Oh, God.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>No, not your tool.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>No, to have to go through that whole process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>To actually get through the entire process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>You’re operating a agency by yourself here, as a ARC holder?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>I have an ARC extension right now, so I’m able to potentially consult.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Awesome. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>She’s wonderful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Yeah, for a few more months, but I have to think about my future and I have to think about what’s going to happen after that expires.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

        </speech>

          <p>I’ve been hearing more successful cases now. Maybe it’s time to try.</p>

        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>If you can utilize your platform to tell these stores, great.</p>

          <p>Yes! I read for Formosa or Taiwan, everybody says it’s impossible. [laughs]</p>

        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Yes, they just give up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Being very close to your content, translating it, and seeing the actual parameters of what I need to put through, I don’t know if I have the accreditations. I am glad these things are in the press and that Taiwan’s trying to get them through, but I want to see a few of my friends go through it and be able to tell the story myself.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>We need to gather these stories. That’s what the whole media project is. Even if they didn’t go through our system, because there’s...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>Just ensure that that process is tried and true.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Yes, tried and true.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Even though they don’t necessarily need an entrepreneur visa, we are going to be providing them all sorts of services to show them, &quot;Hey, we can act as the umbrella organization to get all your service needs, giving you local guides, setting up your bank accounts, finding you a space.&quot; We plan to definitely use case studies to show what we’re doing to promote the good cause of Crossroads.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>It has to start here, because I think the folks that are going to want these visas are folks that already are in love with Taiwan. Taiwan, as a brand, is a different problem or challenge, opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#David Chang">
          <p>Yes.</p>

        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>They were asking some folks that are over here, &quot;What would you pitch?&quot; That’s a question. How do you position Taiwan as a brand? What do you want to show?</p>

          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Didi Bethurum">
          <p>I think a lot of people hold the secrets close to their heart, because they don’t want it to be too exposed, but I also feel like there’s a huge opportunity to market it.</p>

          <p>It’s a little less impossible. To make it a priority bill in the next session, which is a budget session, it is actually pretty challenging. If you remember, the Foreign Talent Act was delayed by one session, some people say two sessions, because there was some concerns about the job market here.</p>

          <p>About the job market?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There’s a long debate about people qualifying for Foreign Talent Act actually creating more jobs than they take, and the jobs they create are better quality jobs, anyway. We’ve got some pretty large names investing hundreds of AI researchers, Microsoft, Google, Oath, etc.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There’s a general sense of, &quot;Yeah, maybe they are creating jobs,&quot; and that helped getting the act actually passed. The new immigration act, because it actually lowers the balance quite a bit, there will be debate, and in a budget period, there is only certain weeks allocated for meaningful debate anyway.</p>

          <p>It’s in the <a href="https://join.gov.tw/policies/detail/1b688f9c-5f05-47ce-ab56-10820643a38a">60-day commentary period</a>. I think it still has like 50 days to go, and then after which the NDC will take the public comments. If there’s lots of comments supporting it and nothing against it, it will go straight to the parliament, which begins the session, I think late September-ish.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think it will start deliberating substantially in October. If it misses the October deliberation period, and it misses November, then it will be the next session. It will be next March, so there is a window in which that we need to get the public, if not enthusiastic, at least not opposing this act.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Certainly, we get the job creators abroad to showcase their quality jobs, and the talent people loves the story that utilizes, for example, when the air lapse of those foreign multinationals speaking establishing in Taiwan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We make sure that their message is on positive social impact, like how it will transform our education, on how it will empower the indigenous and to less empowered communities to revitalize their language with someone from the Common Voice project from Mozilla. I like that a lot, because it is participatory AI. It is not predatory AI.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Basically, by showcasing job creation opportunities that in the same time enhance the social welfare or enhance social solidarity, we’re saying, &quot;The foreigners are here to help us to create a diverse society that can nevertheless find common values.&quot;</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>What people don’t like was in the old, pre-labor act era when there all we had was the 工廠法, the manufacturing plant act, in which practically every foreign company would do large investment in job creation here, as either tradeoff to either environmental sustainability or social stability. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s not the kind of message we want to get across. Still, for people who are older, they still remember the days when the multinationals are here and hired a lot of foreigners, who are essentially in a different class. They may create some jobs, but at the expense of social solidarity or environmental sustainability.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The idea is really pushing it, and it’s part of the Global Entrepreneurship network, and so they’re going to have their own conference here in Taiwan, the summit. Just like in the digital economy, Digital Innovation Forum, which was a APAC thing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Still, what we’re saying is that we’re enabling social impact with AI-plus, I would say. Whatever technology and whatever jobs we create, those are just instruments.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The values are sustainable development, and the values are social solidarity, positive social impact, and so on. That’s the main narrative. Just by saying, &quot;Here are these people who are looking to contribute to Taiwan’s social or environmental...&quot;</p>

          <p>I think these are stories that we can...Let’s see, because if it’s early October, and we’re doing our media campaign aiming to do it late September, maybe we could coordinate or something.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah. There’s a similar campaign from New Zealand a few years ago where they called a Global Impact Visa, or GIVs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They partnered with the Edmund Hillary Foundation to give this special visa that you don’t need any investment. You don’t need any qualification other than that you demonstrate that you can create positive social impact somewhere, and you’re willing to take those skills to New Zealand.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They give you funding, fellowship, investment, and whatever. One of the -- I think it was a lawyer or someone who applied for this, specifically to help the Maori people to give their river personhood, legal personhood.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The river can be part of the board. The river can be part of anything, just like a company, and the river is collaboratively, their interest is being represented by someone from the government and someone from the tribe. That’s because they have a very interesting constitution that is basically a treaty between the Maori people and the colonizers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>This allows for this new kind of legal invention, but then it puts a whole new spin on venture philantrophy, on impact investing, because you’re treating, just like the Maori people did, a river as a person.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s what this kind of narrative does, because at the same time, New Zealand is also bringing up other kinds of resets of courts. By focusing on these kind of stories, the New Zealand see those foreigners as enhancing the Maori spirit or enhancing the local sustainability campaigns.</p>

          <p>Yeah. 自然人憑證 has been around for years, but it only started issuing to ARC holders not even two years ago. It’s good for anything that we can use it for. It’s used as a single sign-on system for practically anything.</p>

          <p>Yes. Traditionally, people think ARC, and it doesn’t translate into online service, because it is not really a card you can do e-signature, according to the Digital Signature Act. Now, we start issuing this card to ARC holders, as well. They’re good as a signature or seal, so it could be used for all kinds of official things.</p>
