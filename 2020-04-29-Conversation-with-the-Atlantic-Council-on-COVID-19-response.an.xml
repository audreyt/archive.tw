                        It’s 9:00 AM in Washington, 9:00 PM in Taipei. Today we are honored to be hosting Taiwan’s Digital Minister, Audrey Tang, for an inside look at her government’s internationally-lauded response to COVID-19. Mr. Tang, welcome back to the Atlantic Council.

                    <p>
                        Hello. Very happy to be virtually here and good local time everywhere.

                    <p>
                        Thank you so much. We’re looking at striking data behind Taiwan’s coronavirus response. One number has jumped out to me in particular, 81. At its closest point, Taiwan is just 81 miles from China. Despite being on the literal front lines of the early outbreak, Taiwan has managed to keep its number of domestic cases below 500.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Damon Wilson">
                    <p>
                        With coordinated measures taken by Taiwan’s government, in spite not being part of the World Health Organization, have made the island one of the greatest success stories of this global pandemic. We’re eager to hear more from Minister Tang about our lessons learned in the battle against COVID-19.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Damon Wilson">
                    <p>
                        It also strikes me that the importance of Taiwan’s success story goes beyond the critical public health lessons that it provides. At a time when authoritarian regimes around the world point to outbreaks in the United States and Europe as false evidence of democracy’s fundamental weaknesses, Taiwan has demonstrated how democracies can leverage core strengths.

                        Including transparency and public trust to provide international aid and coordinate an effective global response alongside the US and its democratic allies and partners. Taiwan has donated millions of masks to parts of the world hit hardest by COVID-19. The Taiwanese research institutions continue to partner on the development of new tests and treatments for the virus.

                    <p>
                        Here at the Atlantic Council, we recognize that securing the post-COVID-19 world isn’t about getting back to where we were before the pandemic. Instead, we’re working to identify, understand, and amplify the kinds of innovative measures we’ve seen in places like Taiwan that will help the United States and its allies and partners move forward to a rules-based international order that is more resilient and coordinated than before.

                    <p>
                        Thank you very much for that introduction, Damon. I am so excited to be here. I feel like on the podcast and every day, like a lot of us, I just feel like I’m reading about everything that has gone wrong with the coronavirus response around the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It just feels like bad news after bad news. I am very excited to get the opportunity to spotlight a good news story in the fight against coronavirus for a change.

                <speech by="#Amy Mackinnon">
                    <p>
                        As you mentioned in your opening remarks there, given Taiwan’s proximity to China and the high amount of travel between the two countries, researchers at John Hopkins had initially estimated that Taiwan would have the second most amount of cases of COVID-19 in the world outside of mainland China. Clearly, that’s not the case.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Amy Mackinnon">
                    <p>
                        In fact, Taiwan is now one of the global success stories when it comes to their coronavirus response, proving that early intervention, smart and innovative leadership, and steps that they took early on in the outbreak were able to produce a markedly different outcome.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now as countries in Europe and the states across the United States look to reopen their economies, there is a lot that we can learn from Taiwan’s experience. Actually, before I will dive into questions, I just want to flag that we’re taking questions from the audience as well.
                    </p>

Without further ado, I shall turn to Minister Tang. Thank you so much for joining us. Just to kick us off, can you just give us an overview of where things stand now in Taiwan?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes. I’m very happy to be joining all of you. Currently, Taiwan feels calm, and also there’s recently a case where we introduced an app that allows people to purchase, preorder a rationed mask.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For people who have not collected their rationed mask, which is 9 medical mask every two weeks if you’re an adult and 10 if you’re a child, you can choose to dedicate the ones you have not collected to international community in need. In just two days, there’s more than two million face masks dedicated by Taiwanese citizens, in just a couple days since we launched this feature.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        This shows that there’s been 100 days since we launched the Central Epidemic Command Center, or the CECC. For 16 consecutive days, there’s no local cases confirmed. We are now in the stage where people are feeling generous.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Amy Mackinnon">
                    <p>
                        Wow. That’s incredible. Congratulations. We feel a long way off from that moment here in Washington DC. Before we talk about the current coronavirus outbreak, I want to talk about previous coronavirus. How did the SARS outbreak of 2003 lay the foundations for Taiwan’s response to this outbreak?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s an excellent question. Ever since the 2003 SARS epidemic, we’ve been reviewing the things that we did not do well. For example, there were no Central Epidemic Command Center that I just mentioned. There was a very confusing, what does the local municipalities do? What do the national government do? The chain of command is very much chaotic back in the SARS days.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think everybody in Taiwan who are above 30 years old remembers how chaotic it was. We decided that 37 people died for that is 37 people too many. It was a particularly traumatic episode where we had to basically barricade an entire hospital without any warning or about the extension of time of which they will be barricaded and so on. Because of this, I would say it’s almost like an inoculation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The whole society mobilized at this time because we’ve been consistently practicing as a society, not just from the government, what to do if SARS happened again. When last year, the last day of last year, last December, when Dr. Li Wenliang, the PRC whistleblower, posted that there are new SARS cases on the social media in the PRC, whereas many jurisdictions began countering and taking that into notice only this year.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We started last year because our local equivalent of Reddit, the PTT Board, as somebody re-posting that, and the head of CDC immediately noted this post and issued an order that says all passengers flying from Wuhan to Taiwan need to start health inspection the very next day. That is the first day of 2020. That’s as if SARS has happened all over again. We’ve been practicing that for the past 17 years.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Amy Mackinnon">
                    <p>
                        Could you just tell that story of how, because I just think it’s fascinating, how local version of effectively Reddit played this huge role in triggering this fantastic response. Just walk me through what happened on that evening of December 31st in Taiwan.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, sure. It’s actually very early morning in December 31st. It was…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s about the same hour, actually, that Dr. Li Wenliang would be questioned by his institution. A few days later, he would be basically punished by the local police station. What happened in Taiwan is that the head of CDC immediately noticed the post which was by someone with the nickname nomorepipe, and it includes the full Li Wenliang whistle-blowing account.

                    <p>
                        This, to me, says two things. First, the civil society trusts the government enough to talk about possible near SARS outbreaks in the public forum. The second is that the government trusts the citizen enough to take it seriously and treat it as if SARS has happened over again, something we’ve always been preparing since 2003.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of this open civil society – according to the CIVICUS Monitor, Taiwan is the most open society in the whole of Asia – we emphasize opening our mind to new, novel ideas like first as an advanced collective-intelligence warning system.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Where did things go from there? You got winds that there was this possibly another SARS outbreak or this new pneumonia spreading in Wuhan. What were the next steps which the government took?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The setting up of the Central Epidemic Command Center, the CECC, is really the most important part. The CECC is an organization with a full authority as authorized by the Act that has been revised by the legislature after SARS so that I think it was in January ‘20s where they started their daily press conferences. Every daily press conferences are live streamed.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We work with the journalist community. The idea is that the press conference is not a one-sided conversation. It’s basically ask me anything so that the Minister of Health and Welfare answer all the question from all the journalists until they run out of questions, which is also live streamed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of this, whenever there is new ideas coming from the civil society, there was a phone line, still is a phone line called 1922. People can just pick up their phone, call 1922, and tell the idea to the CECC, establishing a bi-directional connection between a civil society and a response system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Has that yielded any ideas from civil society that have been implemented?

                    <p>
                        For example, there was one day in April where a young boy that said that they don’t want to go to school because his schoolmates may laugh at him for wearing a pink medical mask.

                    <p>
                        The very next day on the press conference, everybody in the CECC, including the Minister of Health and Welfare, started wearing pink medical mask, making sure that everybody learns about gender mainstreaming, which is also a social innovation.

                        This kind of fast response builds trust between the government and a civil society because people can feel that their ideas is being taken into account in the 24-hour cycle.

                        The main idea, the focus, is fairness. For example, when we ramped up the facial mask production, making sure that everybody can use their National Health Insurance card to collect a mask from nearby pharmacies, not only do we publish the stock level of all the pharmacies as other countries with an FOIA would do, but we publish it every three minutes, which is very different.

                    <p>
                        In most government bureaucracies, we publish at the end of the day because you want somebody looking at the numbers to make sure that it hasn’t gone horribly wrong, or wrong by orders of magnitude, or things like that. We connect directly to NHI, the National Health Insurance system to open data.

                        Everybody in the world has access to all the stock level almost like a distributor ledger every three minutes. That’s why g0v and many community contributors builds more than 130 tools that enable people who prefer view maps to view where are the nearest pharmacy that still have this medical mask in stock.

                        Because Taiwan has more than 99.99 percent of health coverage, people who show any symptom will then be able to take the medical mask, go to a local clinic, knowing that they will get treated fairly without incurring any financial burden. That enabled people to make the decisions that are pro-social out of selfish reasons. This is the incentive design that technology have enabled.

                        One of the key strategies which we’ve seen used over and over again in countries that have successfully managed to handle their outbreaks has been contact tracing. How did you go about doing that in Taiwan? What role did technology play in that?

                        The contact-tracing technologies in Taiwan is based on classical contact tracing, interviews and so on. We put special care on the port control. Because we’re basically a bunch of islands, there’s no way to accidentally stumble on Taiwan. You probably have to arrive through an airport or a seaport.

                        At the port level, we make sure that people who return from a high-risk area, the entire plane, all the passengers and the itself goes into a centralized quarantine. If it’s coming from a lower-risk place, people who show any symptom, of course, they’ll get quarantined and treated. The people without symptoms are still home quarantined in their homes.

                        The population really insisted to play a co-detective role. There’s a lot of people calling 1922 about the suspected cases, suspected symptoms, and things like that. We have to massively assign a lot of staff to answer those calls, to triage those calls, and so on. It’s really effective.

How are you managing this conflict?

                        As I mentioned, we began health inspection for flight passengers flying from Wuhan the very first day of this year. As of January 10th, I think, WHO did not recommend health inspection for flight passengers from Wuhan to its member countries. Had we have direct access to the minister’s level through the WHO, the entire world will gain 10 precious days because of our early warning.

                        We do have access to some of the scientific communities. Unless you happen to have, like our vice president, literally the person who wrote the textbook on epidemiology, who are both a scientist and also our vice president, the scientific access is not the same as ministerial access.

                        I’m not the Vice President — Chen Chien-jen — so I cannot comment too much on vaccines. Suffice it to say that we really want vaccines, because currently, we rely on the physical vaccine, that is the medical mask, but we all understand it doesn’t scale to the entire world. Only vaccines scale to the entire world.

                        Civic hackers. We used to call the technologies that the civic hackers make civic tech, meaning that everybody can participate. This is the first time that they think that they’re actually civil engineers, as in like the pharmacy mask map that they produced is used by over half of the population, making it as much a infrastructure as roads and bridges.

                        The simplest is the medical mask. We’ve made many donations, dozens of millions, to countries suffering from the pandemic, and also especially for medical workers. There’s also personal protective equipment to Italy, ventilators to Prague, and many other countries as well. I think the main thing that we can share, aside from those medical supplies, is the Taiwan model.

It reminds you to wash your hands properly while it actually protects others.

Those were closed down because there’s no feasible way to maintain social distance in such businesses. Other than that, everything like karaoke or whatever still remains open.

                        It is quite a privilege in Taiwan to have people who worry about these things, because there are a lot of places where there is no other resort than total lock down which, of course, infringes the privacies and the social freedoms even more. They do keep us honest. They do ask for accounts for everything that we do, because it’s under normal law and not emergency law.
