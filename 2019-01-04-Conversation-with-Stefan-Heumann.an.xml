        <heading>2019-01-04 Conversation with Stefan Heumann</heading>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I don’t need to take any notes, because I will get a transcript from you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right, yes. We get to edit for 10 days before publishing to the general public. Feel free to edit afterwards.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Does this have some voice recognition technology, or do you have somebody transcribe it, listen to it, transcribe for you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s a combination. We use this microphone array, mostly because it enables better automatic recognition. If we talk about domain-specific words, for example, there will be another pass where people go through transcript, and fix the terminologies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>If you use some software, I would be interested to know what it is. We run a lot of events, and we don’t have the means to live-stream. We have done transcripts. Lots of people read our transcripts, but normally, what we do is we just record it, and we have somebody then type out a transcript.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, we tried a lot of suppliers. The early ones, the first one that worked really well was called Trint. Recently, we’ve switched to Temi, which I think is just Google underneath.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I have to see if, our events are mostly in German. Can I take a screenshot of this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course. There’s many offers from IBM, from Microsoft, from Google.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Thank you. Let me first maybe tell you a little bit about myself. I’m Stefan. I’m from Berlin in Germany. I’m there with a think tank - &quot;Stiftung Neue Verantwortung&quot;. It’s a nonprofit organization. We are not affiliated with any political party, so we are independent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We are a team of about 20 people, and we work mostly on issues of new technologies, digital technologies from cyber security to open government, to what can we do with AI, and how do we need to regulate it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>What are the problems with new technologies, what are the potentials? Actually, from the way we work, it’s very similar...Not similar, but has some similarities to your thinking about how policy should be done. We talk a lot about our methodology, because we have been asking ourselves, what is differentiates our think tank from a research institute at university?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We’ve found that, especially in these new technologies, it takes very long for academics to write papers about it. There’s peer review process. It takes quite some time until their expertise is out. You need expertise very quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The policymakers are asking very quickly, “What can we do about this?” Often, the technology companies are much faster than the understanding in the broader public, and also in the politics. What we do in our organizations is research sprints, like sprints you would do in agile development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s agile.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Then we do workshops, where we test our ideas. The workshops, because as a nonprofit, it’s very important for us that our problem analysis, and also the solution we propose, are public interest-based.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We try to invite people from all different sectors. We actually call it intersectoral. We try to invite government people, because we want to inform the government in exchange for collaboration, and we want them to take up the ideas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We invite the business and tech community because they develop these new technologies. Often, they come from them. We need to understand what they are doing, so we need to make them part of the conversation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We also have very strong relationships to civil society organizations and NGOs who really, or independent academics, or people engaged or working with organization’s like the Chaos Computer Club you may have heard about in Germany.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Hackers, independent experts. They’re really important for us to bring the public interest perspective on this. With them, in the research sprint, we try to frame the problem, lay out hypotheses on how we think about it. Then we use a lot of these design thinking methodologies in terms of how we test them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yes, I’m very familiar with that kind of work, and our office like that, too. A lot of posters, lots of sticky notes, lots of brainstorming happening there. Our funding comes mostly from foundations, like 70 percent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We have some money from the corporate side, but it’s very difficult for us to get, because we don’t do corporate sponsorships. We cannot compromise our independence. They have to make a donation to the institution, and they don’t get branding visibility or influence on our...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They don’t control your research agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yeah, so that makes it hard to convince them...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Not very attractive. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We have found some people who think it’s important to have an independent organization doing this. Sometimes, we collaborate with government, and government will support some of our work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>This is one, some of the things that I’m really interested in your perspective. What we have is, I think, actually, that we are also doing, we’re providing a service to different communities that we bring together. Especially to the government. It’s really hard to figure this out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We have also seen that we are constantly also in some tension with government, because we are pushing the ideas. They often have some ideas of what they want to do. If you bring in all these different stakeholders, they don’t control the agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They don’t control the outcomes of the workshops, of the thinking, of the discussions. There are some people in government open to that, but often, they are lower in the hierarchy, in my experience. The higher you go in the hierarchies, the harder it is to get people interested in this kind of approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Until you reach the very top, where they become interested again.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yes, but to get to the top, you have to go through a lot of layers underneath. German government is structured very formalistic, hierarchical.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I mean the topmost, like the Digitalrat, the digital consultation council.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>There’s a question how the digital council that was just created, how they can have impact, because of they’re a separate orbit from what happens in the ministries. I’m very interested in your experience, how you get buy-in from ministries, and how you create positive relationships with them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I would imagine that you don’t sit within a single ministry, so you’re also sometimes seen...I don’t know if you’re perceived as an outsider.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>No, not at all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>How you manage to get in? I’m really interested in this perspective. Maybe just personal background, what brought me here. I’m married to a Taiwanese. I met her in the United States. I got my PhD in political science in the United States. We met there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I’ve been coming to Taiwan every year for more than 10 years. She’s a big supporter of the equal marriage and other social issues. She has been following those campaigns, and has been very disappointed by the outcome of the referendum.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Well, it’s binding for two years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>From her, and also from other people, I heard about the work that you’re doing. People told me you’re very open, so I just tried to contact you through Twitter, as you saw.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, just one tweet away.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Thought we also have some overlapping interests in how we work, and I think your approach also, in trying to reach out, and bring civil society in a collaborative way, to find solutions. It’s exactly our philosophy, that we need to find collaborative solutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I was really interested in meeting you, hearing from your perspective, learning, and also asking you, so far, have you had any engagements with counterparts in Germany? How you see that, and maybe if there’s any opportunities to facilitate that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>You’re here for the holiday season?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yeah, basically, because there was Christmas, New Year’s, so it’s holidays in Germany. I know it’s not the best time of the year to visit Taiwan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We’re warmer in January, actually.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s right. You’re warmer, but often, there’s a lot of rain. It feels cold here, because of the humidity, and there’s no heating. This, now, I’m actually quite concerned. This year feels so weird. We had such a hot summer in Germany. There’s no winter. It’s not really cold. I think this is also warmer than normal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I can really feel the climate not being normal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s a new normal. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I’m hoping more people will wake up and do more about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It’s also an interesting question, what role technology can play in this. We have also an energy problem, where we look at...Germany has done a lot of investing in renewable energy. We are trying to get out of nuclear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The problem is that, with renewable energy, you have a decentralized system, where you don’t control the feed in. When the sun is shining, the wind blows, you have lots of energy, but not necessarily when people want it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Which is why you need a smart grid...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yeah, and we don’t even think you need a smart grid anymore. The smart grid idea from 20 years ago was a centralized idea, that you have some centralized authority that manages the grid. What we really think is that you need a decentralized smart grid.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Give people -- we call it prosumers in Germany -- give people directly the ability, who have a solar system or wind system, and they’re able to directly trade, and directly feed in energy. There is now a low transaction cost of digital platforms as a way to implement this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The German system on a regulatory level, we are not there yet. There’s still very old industry, coal interests in Germany, and nuclear interests, like you have here in Taiwan, that are pushing back on this, too. We think that this peer-focused, decentralized systems are really important in solving some social problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It’s how do we get people involved in shaping the policies we need for that, and pushing the government to adopt them, I see as a very big challenge.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>In Taiwan, even the pro-nuclear people are also pro-renewable. I think that renewable is very much something that everybody agrees on. When we talk about smart grid, there’s actually enabling laws and regulations that enables, for example, indigenous communities and so on to completely own the hydro, solar, wind power plants in their indigenous lands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We’re now figuring out ways for them to trade back with the grid system nearby. I think it’s not just economy, it is actually a regional revitalization, because then they identify with the sovereignty of their indigenous lands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s very important to have critical all understood and managed by the local people. It goes beyond the economic argument, it is mostly a social solidarity around the energy that everybody can understand and participate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think both pro and anti-nuclear people are actually in favor of that idea. It’s actually easier to push now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Actually, the indigenous communities are leading this in Taiwan?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>A lot of indigenous communities are very interested. I’ve personally visited one, the Taromak community of the Rukai nation. They worship the sun god. Actually, it’s the same word that they use for the sun god and the solar panel. It’s like solar panel is incarnation of the solar spirit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They have a hydro plant in their region, and they have a few wind turbines as well. Mostly, they are focusing on solar at the moment. The three combined together takes care for more than 100% of their need.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They are now figuring out a way to share it to other communities. That will, of course, need a lot of design. Previously, exactly as you said, it’s transmit everything to Taipower, and Taipower redistribute it back.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Now, they are working on peer-to-peer relationships. There is some social enterprises formed as a local association-controlled companies. There’s also some co-ops in this space. There’s different structures.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You need to put the policy in place to support them. Is there also some funding that the government gives for this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yes, of course. The <a href="http://www.rootlaw.com.tw/LawArticle.aspx?LawID=A040100151008900-1070308">regulations</a> are already there. It’s just the interpretation and operation, because nobody have done this before. This is very new to everybody.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We need a lot of operational infrastructure to make this happen. For example, there are existing electricity lines that Taipower has left over in that area. Can they reuse those lines instead of setting up new lines, and how should the peak and non-peak costs be calculated?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The operation needs to be understood, administered, and governed by the indigenous people in their land, instead of far away, in a control center in a Taipower building, and things like that. It doesn’t really need regulatory change, but it does need an algorithmic change. That kind of code change, not the legal code change.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Have you had any interactions with the green movement in Germany on these issues?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Sure, yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>With what kind of organizations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The Green Party of Taiwan is part of the Global Green.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>This is not the DPP? The Green Party is separate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>No, the Green Party is the Green Party. Taiwan has a Green Party, also the Tree Party, and so on, like the Global Green. Of course, marketing-wise, it’s difficult, because the DPP looks green. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yes, I think that’s right. That’s why I just want to make sure that I understand right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right. Maybe I should say &quot;Green as in SDGs&quot;. [laughs] There’s quite a few concerted movements, as well as shared agenda, with the Global Greens in the local level. Again, the greens, or the Tree Party and related parties, they have captured recently the city councilors’ spots, but not at the legislative level yet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Most of the political alliances are still on the local level, which is, I think, good. We’re now seeing a lot of the national development into what we call the Regional Revitalization, which is literally have these different precincts and districts, which 134 and them, totally a majority of the land area in Taiwan, but actually less than one-tenth of the population.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Because this registered household, and many people don’t actually live in these places. There is huge amounts of places that are currently suffering from dwindling population, aging population, different structure that makes a vicious cycle of a lack of employment, and a lack of infusion of population, and so on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The main theme of this year is what we call Regional Revitalization, which is to make sure that the people here get to control their own agenda, of local development, with the end goal of basically reaching an equilibrium of population in two years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They are starting to have a brain gain instead of brain drain in these areas...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Your role in this is also to organize the engagements with the local population, with this model that you have developed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yes, exactly. So far, we’ve used two methodologies. One is the regional tour. Maybe you have read about it, where I go to different places, and literally have the 12 ministries’ people see through two-way video conference what the local people’s need are.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Starting this year, we’re also expanding this model to the youth council. There’s a youth advisory council in the administration level. We’re also having the youth councilors, who many of them are actually local organizers for Regional Revitalization, to invite these people to actually visit their place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Not just across the screen, but actually to the locality. The National Development Council is working on the enabling technologies. For example, many of these areas told us that autonomous vehicles, especially drone delivery, is critical.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Otherwise, just getting the necessary material is difficult for them. They have to drive a very long distance, for example. Autonomous delivery is a key. Another one is teleworking. A lot of work here is actually to enable the, I think more than 100 public servants have design up to the National Development Council’s call for them to relocate back to their homeland, and to work there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Through teleworking initiatives...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You have fiber in the ground to reach all these communities, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right, along with 4G LTE coverage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>For telework, you need quite good connections.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right. Anywhere in Taiwan, even in the most remote island like Dongsha, if you don’t have 10 megabits per second, it’s our fault. Broadband is a human right. We’ve been laying out the basic infrastructure for the past couple years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Now, we are reasonably sure the vast majority of these areas in need for revitalization have good bandwidth...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Some remote areas, it’s very costly. Your telecommunications company is probably private. Is that private infrastructure?</p>

          <p>The Chunghwa Telecom, although a private company, is I think more than 30 percent owned by the administration. Actually, it’s not just the Ministry of Transportation. I think there’s other ministries who have shares in that company as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They’re one of the telecom providers, but they are more willing to absorb the necessary cost by, for example, during the 4G band bidding, as well as the 5G in the future... The idea is always that if you get a priority placement, you’re expected to work on the places also with less developed, or less economical to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They have a big debate in this, because we have an auction now in Germany on bandwidth that’s good for...It’s supposed to be used for 5G technology. Actually, the telecommunication companies are suing the government against the requirements to also, because they say it’s not economically for them to go into...</p>

          <p>...to serve areas that are not very densely-populated, because you wouldn’t have many customers there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The point is that it’s not asking them to operate at a loss. It is asking them to put in the infrastructure so when we do Regional Revitalization, they will actually regain the infrastructure payments, assuming, of course, that some of these regions actually do get revitalized.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If you don’t couple it with this narrative, of course, it will seems as if the state is forcing the telecom to operate at a loss. I think it’s very important to couple the two narratives together. Well, we’re not asking them to operate at a loss indefinitely....</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It is worth it to put in the upfront investment that enables teleworking in particular. If the government workforce, the public servants working on these projects, all get teleworking from within those precincts and districts, they can bring all those data to the locality.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Then tell the local organizers, what is it like to see that region from a government, whole picture kind of view? Then they can discover their own identity, take the stakeholders, and put on a proposal. Then, very different than the previous government projects, it is on an on-demand, agile workflow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There’s no one-month window for proposing, two-month window for budget, or anything like that. It is basically all real-time service.</p>

          <p>Wow.</p>

          <p>It’s one of the larger public administration infrastructure change that’s being engineered.</p>

        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>How did you get the ministries here in Taipei to buy into this? Maybe you can explain this puzzle to me. On the one hand, I’m very impressed, because even before you joined the government, Taiwan was already pretty active on open government and open data, and has a very strong record on this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>On the other side, you have traditionally pretty hierarchical, formalistic bureaucracies, and that also, like Germany, tend to, as you go to the senior level, they are older and more detached from the new technological developments. How do you explain that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think open government is embraced because, compared to the NGOs, compared to the social sector, the public sector actually have less legitimacy. I think that is the answer to your question. In Taiwan, we lifted the martial law in the late ’80s, but the first presidential election is only in the late ’90s.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There is a decade where the regional co-ops, the regional NGOs, and so on, very well-known names, have been building their legitimacy during that decade. Even today, when we go to, for example, disaster recovery or whatever, if the public sector publish a normal and the social sector publish a number, most people will believe the social sector number.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The public sector is working with a legitimacy deficient.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s interesting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Because of that, open government is the only way forward, in the sense of...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The narrative that I’m often using in Germany is that it’s for them, they need to learn. It’s also for knowledge transfer, too. For them, they should embrace this, because it will make their policies stronger. The government has a strong legitimacy and a strong history in Germany.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Sure. It works because it has a high legitimacy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Traditionally, they have had their own expertise, and they did everything in-house. To get them to understand that collaboration can actually be better for them, because they mostly, when they go outside, they have this problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They get criticized. They get pushback. They don’t have a very positive image of engaging with civil society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There’s lots of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Not all of them understand that this could be actually positive for them, and actually could make their work more effective. Do you also use this kind of narrative, where it’s really about legitimacy?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Not much. I usually say, “This is a safe space.” If you go to the Social Innovation Lab to have a conversation, the people, even if they are angry, they are not going to punch you across the screen.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I emphasize the safety of the engagement. Then the safety means actually less risk for everybody involved. That’s one. The second is that the credit is shared. Across the screen, in Mandarin, we say 見面三分情 — there’s a 30 percent of trust just by meeting alone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Once you meet somebody in-person, it’s less likely for the people to start protesting, or with a more ad hominem angle, because they’ve already met you before.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Even across the screen, I think it enables maybe 20 percent [laughs] of trust. Once people get to know each other, actually, they can’t really be that vicious in their communications. That’s the risk of a risk-reducing part.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s probably also your experience, that you have to bring the people into the same room. The video screen can be a first step. It’s important, but really, the real relationship building is for people still to get physically present in the same room.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s two rooms, and each one facilitated by a facilitator. That is what we call connected rooms. Each one, as you said, it is a face-to-face meeting. We’ve been doing for more than a year now. Overwhelmingly, I think people in Taipei appreciate the fact that they don’t have to go to all those rural areas. It’s just me who travels. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Just you. You travel a lot.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right. They also appreciate to learn the actual story. Previously, they just get their stories as two pages of A4 papers, or a few slides of presentation. They can’t really reconstruct in their head, how is it like to be in that locality?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They really do appreciate that instead of the Minister of Interior passing two pages of A4 papers to the Ministry of Health or to the Ministry of Economy, they are actually all in the same room, and listening to the same story.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They do appreciate that, because there’s a lot of back and forth, and real communication. I think this is a more equalizing force between the professionalism of the public service and the local people, who now see them not as anonymous, but actually as a cohort of colleagues who can brainstorm and solve their longstanding problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Once they do solve the problem, and brainstorm in this atmosphere, there’s a lot of appreciation of the professional capacity of the public servants. It’s all on public record, right? Previously, the credit is absorbed by the minister. Now, the credit is back to anyone who actually contribute.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Do you prepare the government officials before you go into the engagement?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Oh, yeah, of course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Do you do a workshop with them to get them ready, explain them, and answer their questions or concerns they have about this kind of format?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Very much so. As I said, the risk-reducing is really just the entry. Even more important, I think, is to actually prepare everyone so that they learn that these meetings are not there to make them overwork, or to make them commit on things that they’re not prepared to commit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Rather so, it is mostly to prepare them to shift from a trade-off kind of thinking to a synergy kind of thinking. We do do workshops, and in each ministry, there is a team of participation officers whose whole work is to meet with strangers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Every month, we look at what training topics are there in the previous month. We decide on one or two topics to collaborate. Even if a ministry doesn’t have any case, they can still join as co-facilitators, as creators, to the other ministry’s cases, and do capacity building before they actually get a burning issue on their hands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I think this is all really valuable in terms of also just changing the culture in the ministry and the mindset, as you said, to go from combative to collaborative. What I’ve seen, and what often are the biggest problems of these processes, is how you make them sustainable, and let the people who participate see that there’s actually outcomes produced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That there is actually policies implemented, so that this is not just having good conversations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Like we say, the new tax filing system now has 96 percent approval rating. This is a boon to everybody participating.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>How have you integrated this in the process that people can track the follow-up from what was discussed at the workshops? How do you do that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We build an accountability trail, an account for the policymaking. The basic idea is that we go back to the Join platform to reply with the tracking updates.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s a website where people can check their update?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There is the <a href="https://join.gov.tw/">e-participation website</a>. The website actually has more than five million users. With Taiwan being 23 million, it’s actually like a quarter of population. The website, very interestingly, is not only used by the administration.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Actually, one of the most active users, apart from the cities, counties, and administration, is actually the auditing department, the Ministry of Auditing in the Corrective Yuan, which is another organ. It’s an independent accountability organ apart from the administration.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>What they do is that whenever any government, like a city government, tries a new way of doing things, they’re in charge of auditing it. Previously, if they block that innovation, for example, the Taipei City used to use, for example, subsidy to have employment opportunities for the handicapped people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>For people with disabilities, there’s a fix set of staff where they can help exactly X number of people with disabilities to work in various duties every month. It’s very easy to audit. You just see whether those vacant positions are filled with people with disabilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>A few years ago, the Taipei City shifted the experiment with what they call the Social Enterprise Building, the SE Square. It’s a building where they rented, at a normal price -- like one Taiwan dollar per month or something -- to social enterprises, but they have to recruit people with disabilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The idea is that the social enterprises will be motivated to recruit more people, because they have more fiscal control and freedom. The people with disability can even join the board as a co-op, or things like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s very hard to audit. It’s not very clear that, if they have not yet recruited X number of people with a disability, is it because it’s just ramping up, that it’s dwindling, or how does it even work, over the course of five years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>There’s fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the civil society, as well as in the city council. Now, the Corrective Yuan, of course, is charged in building a new auditing mechanism for this. Previously, if they blocked this innovation, then, of course, they will charged by the press, saying, “You’re blocking civic innovation.”</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If they build an accountability mechanism that’s not really accountable, then of course, the civic councilors will say that they are not doing a very good job to address the concerns. Now, with the joint platform, what they do is that they just say, “OK, we see the city is now trying a new thing. What are your doubts and fears about it?”</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Usually, we see hundreds of citizens just coming and sharing their fears, uncertainty, and doubt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Do the people share anonymously, or do people share with...</p>

          <p>Pseudonym?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Right. They have to authenticate with an SMS number and an email or a social media login, so we know that they are actually at least SMS-holding.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>So that they are really here, resident in Taiwan, and so on?</p>

        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You can get anonymous SIM cards here. This is a big issue in Germany, and privacy is a big concern. As you know, they have -- also in Taiwan -- there’s discussions about the problem of disinformation, and potentially foreign influence.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think with the SMS number, it’s actually kind of difficult to flood the forum. We do get some personal attacks, and so on, but there is a well-known way to fix those, by only responding to the one that are constructive, and hide the part that are not constructive.</p>

          <p>My office is, at most, one person from each ministry. At most, I can have 34 colleagues, because we have 34 ministries. At the moment, I have 22.</p>

          <p>There’s a vendor, UDN Digital, building this website and keeping it running. I think it’s a team of 30 or so. In the National Development Council, there is also an operation strategy team that think about, for example, what kind of regulatory announcements, what kind of budget to highlight, and things like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s maybe five people or so. In each ministry, there’s a team of participation officers, as I said. I think on average, it’s three or four people per ministry. Altogether, it’s maybe 200 people, but not working full-time. Maybe 100 people or so full-time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I think it’s important to have your own resources, to give out a contract when you need some website development, or some services to implement. Where you’re not doing this in public-private partnerships, or partner with companies that help you do this.</p>

          <p>That’s right.</p>

        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I know her very well. She’s done a very... I don’t know if she told you about the Prototype Fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It’s really innovative what she’s doing, and also transforming how our ministries work, who are funding the Prototype Fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think she directly inspired the g0v grant, which is again like the Prototype Fund. The g0v people, of course, in traditional g0v fashion, did not accept funding from the government, or from any political parties.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>This is entirely in the social sector, and I think it’s been running really well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I think to scale, you have to put public resources behind those things. I think you see a lot of great initiatives in civil society that don’t scale, or are not sustainable, because they run out of...A lot of foundations only want to give seed funding.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Obviously, you know this problem. There is no resources for followup. What is your comment on the German AI strategy, or what is your thinking on it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>First of all, I think of AI as &quot;assistive intelligence&quot;, and machine learning as collaborative is part of my interview with Julia. I remember pointing out that machine learning, it’s not just an “industry” strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It is actually a social strategy as well, if everybody, including schoolchildren, understand how machine learning works, then it is an empowering force of so-called personal computing, because people can feel that everybody can customize and relate to these ideas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>On the other hand, if few people understand it, then even if you build the best privacy by design, you build the best overcoming bias, or whatever into it, just by the lack of literacy, it is still as good as a top-down machinery.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think the common awareness and education, and especially empowerment through regulatory co-creation, through the freedom to customize, the freedom to self-organize around machine learning apparatus and to make new norms, I think that really is the key.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think the education strategy has a lot to say, at least equal with the industry. I think that’s the main idea.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The problem in Germany is that the education, we have a federal system. The education policy is made on the state level.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I’m aware of that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The national government cannot mandate certain education policies. This is a big problem currently in Germany. Some states are better than others in terms of trying to integrate new approaches and new knowledge into the curriculum, and others are really not doing that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The learning part, this is actually a topic that will be important for our work in the parliament commission. The national AI strategy was very much driven by economic and industrial concerns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s exactly right. It’s quite clear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It’s very clear. You’ve seen that. The first chapters are all about that, how you can have the best research, and how you can transmit that into industry and startups. That’s the core. Then towards the end, you find some...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>You find something that, “OK, we won’t harm the European values. We’ll fill the AI with European characteristics.”</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We actually need to start it. With the process I described to you, we actually in our organizations tried to start that conversation around an AI strategy. We were very much also thinking about how you democratize AI, and give as many people access to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>This is obviously a question of the accessibility of the technology. Is it all going to be owned by corporate entities, or do we continue at the moment? A lot of this is open source available. How can we make sure...?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Like this is one of the open source examples of self-driving vehicles. If you go to the Social Innovation Lab, today, actually they have it running like this. They have visited the Social Innovation Lab three times from the MIT Media Lab.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>All of this open hardware and open source. When the local people want to accommodate their flow -- for example, shopping in the flower market -- and have those tricycles follow you, and form a fleet. Basically, adjust their distance to people, and signal their internal state through a way that people can understand.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Like there’s people with feedback saying, “This is almost like a cyclops. It’s not very friendly.” The latest iteration -- because it’s open hardware, you can just tinker it -- now use two eyes. They make eye contact.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>People come, it’s like students and people interested come to work with this technology and build things?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, I think that’s a very good idea of people seeing self-driving vehicles, and think of these things, instead of truck fleets.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>These are full of sensors?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, they have a cheap LIDAR and optical sensors, which is why they can make eye contact.</p>

          <p>I think Taiwan also has an AI strategy. Were you involved in...?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>How would you describe how they address really the social? Really, what bothers me about the discussion in Germany, they always talk about the Chinese AI strategy, but they always talk about what’s done in Beijing. Nobody looks at innovative approaches towards AI that are coming out of Taiwan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Again, we put a lot of emphasis on education.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Also, I need to look this up. This is even available in English?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, it’s called <a href="https://ai.taiwan.gov.tw/">AI Taiwan</a>. If you google for AI Taiwan, I think this is the first hit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I will check this out. I will find that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We did a domain name hack. It’s ai.taiwan.gov.tw. It can’t be this because of SEO.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I’ll find this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Right. As you can see, even in our, education, I talk about. Regulatory co-creation is mostly, we allow the social innovators through those Regional Revitalization planning and touring, to basically declare their own hometown as in need of one particular intelligent technology, like the drone delivery, as I talk about.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Then they can get to break existing laws and regulations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They can get some exemptions from national regulations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Exactly, yes, to test out the parameters.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They will need to get the approval from the national government to do such a test bed, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right. Basically, you need to have an application in what we call the sandbox system, which is not just for AI, of course. It’s also for fintech, for platform economy. It is a shared front end for anyone who want to break the law for a year. You go to here and file in your lawbreaking proposal.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>(laughter)</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Don’t think of it as lawbreaking. It’s like forking, having your own version of the law, and test it for a year. Everybody can apply, saying whether it is a good idea or not. By the end of the year, people may want to extend it to test in another to study that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The main applicant would be a city, a local community, a city council, or something?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It could be anyone. It could be anyone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It can also be a private company?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It could be a private company, and even with your own business plan. We don’t discriminate between the organization. Of course, the more multistakeholder you are, the better. The end result is to get the multistakeholder to decide collectively whether this experiment works for the local revitalization or not.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>How do you determine that, if it works?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>A consultation process. Usually, we use things like Pol.is, which can highlight the people’s divisive arguments, as well as the consensus statements. It is itself AI-powered. Anyone can go in and see their place among the different clusters of their neighbors.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Then they can propose their feelings for everybody to vote. People can vote agree or disagree. As they do, their position move toward the people who feel likely.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>This is very interesting. This basically means that you need a lot of people familiar with this moderation and collaborative process, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Oh, yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Have you created some sort of academy, where you train people in these kind of competences? You not only need them on the national level, but you need them in the communities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>On the local level.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>On the local level. You will need to be giving trainings all the time, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Actually, the 區公所, the District Office, is going to be the coordinating agency. Of course, there’s many district offices. In our public service academy, we have an e-academy. We recorded our collaborative workshops, our training materials.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I personally trained around a hundred. No, actually 900 or so people, even before joining the cabinet. Of course, after joining the cabinet, we trained even more people. We record that, and put it on the e-academy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>When do you sleep? [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Every night, for eight hours.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>This methodology spreads by itself, because each collaborative meeting, which lasts for five to six hours, is by itself a training program.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s my experience. You cannot just tell people theoretically, “This is how it works.” They need to do it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s training by doing, that’s right. Basically, this is what we call osmosis. The more you get into this participatory system, the more you can feel confident when it comes your turn to run it. That’s the basic idea.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If the stakeholders end up have a consensus around this particular technology, then we’re committed to merge it back into the regulation, so that every other region can use it as well. If the experiment end up being people’s consensus saying, “This is not actually a good fit,” again, nothing is lost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We all learn something, and the new innovators can try something else. It is almost like monopoly, actually. If the legislation decides that this needs a legislative change, they can take three or four years to actually a pass a law that actually remedy the shortcoming they see from this experiment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>During those three or four years, the business model itself is still legit. The experiment extends to the point where the legislation is happy with it. You have a de facto monopoly for three years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>What’s also great is that you make the law based on real experience and testing. This is one of the problems, that we make a law, and then we look, “Oh, what happens?” Then we see, “Oh, it doesn’t work out like we wanted it to be.”</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Policymakers cannot regulate something we don’t have first-hand experience. Unless we all ride the self-driving tricycle, how are going to suppose to make useful laws to govern them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s exactly, this is really interesting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Our AI strategy is regulatory co-creation. That is one of the five strategies here, the regulatory co-creation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It’s one of the core pillars.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>One of the five pillars.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The other one is talent?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Talent, democratization...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Is education?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>AI Pilot is similar to DARPA, and it’s IP, where we put out grant challenges for very difficult...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Have you created some agency like DARPA for this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>At the moment, it’s managed by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Board of Science and Technology. It’s not defense, [laughs] but it is science and technology. At the moment, they’re running a grant challenge.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We are discussing this in Germany, too. There we’ll be probably, too, not very comfortable with the military angle in Germany about this, too. We will create a civilian DARPA in Germany as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Finally, we work with the MSMEs of the innovative...The industries need innovation. The industry innovation, which is various upcoming industries in Taiwan, many of the MSMEs, they surface the main challenges that they’re facing, and that could be automated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>For example, the water company, the Water Corporate of Taiwan, said that the water leakage detection is one of the most time-consuming part of their work. Their experts, using a listening device, have to circulate Taiwan for a year and a half before new leakage is discovered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>They really need machine learning to help them to identify the one that are most likely. They use these as training material for AI academy and other talent training. It’s not just solving puzzles for practice, but actually to solve real challenges, as posed by the MSMEs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>What’s important is that this is not asking for a perfect solution. Even if your solution only improve the efficiency by five percent or so, it is still a real gain for a MSME. It also makes the talents much more likely to integrate back to the industry, instead of just going elsewhere.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think this is a pretty good solution to do AI-driven by essentially training experienced designers that can redesign their workflows for full integration. We already have experience of working with people with diverse mental neurodiversity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If we’re going to integrate people with Down syndrome or people with handicaps into the workflow, you have to redesign the workflow so that they can work on the part that they are good at, without burdening them with the part that they are not good.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Now, we are seeing AI as a kind of people, who need to be integrated into the workforce. It is the same experience design, service design work that need to be done. We integrate those kind of designers into the MSMEs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Allow them to surface the part that are trivial, that really need automation, and then introduce the AI students as the solution givers to partner with the MSMEs. That’s the other part of the five pillars.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Wow. You’re really ahead of us. I knew it before, but now, talking to you, I can see really that. It’s very impressive. Also, how the things are connected. I really like that, how the thinking is very integrated. That’s really cool.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I’m glad you’ve heard about the German Digitalrat. One of the -- I don’t want to say problem, it’s always better to talk about challenges -- one of the challenges of the Digitalrat is that it’s not permanent. They are coming in from the outside.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s a more advisory role.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>At some point, it’s going to be, advisory role. What we really need is somebody like you, who really is in day-to-day contact with the ministries, and driving innovation. Hopefully, the Digitalrat can get our government to adopt those kind of approaches, to make it permanent, and scalable across government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The challenge has not been that there has not been a lack of...We’ve been talking about open data, open government, and things like that for a while in Germany. Our challenge is implementation. It’s not having ideas. It’s about implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>For implementation, you need to talk about collaboration. You need to talk about mind shift, culture shift, working differently, then changing things, how you used to work. Have you seen in your work, what would you describe as your personally, the biggest challenges?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>A lot of people in the German government will tell me that the biggest challenges for them is, we have 50 years of bureaucracy, so there is lots of rules that determine how things need to be done. It’s very difficult for them to step outside of these rules and formal processes that have been designed over many decades, and do things differently.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We don’t think it’s a large problem here, mostly because even though we’re also a continental law jurisdiction, we explicitly carve out parts that are good for experiment. The sandbox laws are essentially the legislation saying, “It’s OK to break the law for a while.”</p>

        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>That’s very hard for Germans to adopt that kind of thinking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right, but I think it’s really worth it. If you don’t have a clear-cut sandbox, then of course, there is literally hundreds of obscure rules and interpretations that can block your way. You don’t discover them until you run into them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I think a canvas, or a sandbox, with strictly-set geographic and/or time boundaries, I think that is really the main innovation vehicle that we’re working on. That also enables, like for 5G, everybody understand that 5G is good for something, but we’re not quite sure something. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>At the moment, we are encouraging dozens, if not hundreds, of different vertical experiments on 5G, but always test spectrum that’s good for maybe a couple years. Then if they found that 5G is really not the problem, we really need to have some fiber instead, then maybe it’s not a very good fit for 5G technology.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>You have open spectrum?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We’ve been pushing for that in Germany, too, and it’s very, very difficult to get.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The tests need to be limited by geography.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I know. There’s interference problems. Because there was lots of spectrum opening up with the switch to digital TV and things, same here. Then we are auctioning everything off.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>To the telecoms?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Yeah, and the telecoms are very keen to get it, of course, but we have said there should be some spaces for experimentation. Look at what Wi-Fi. We wouldn’t have that innovation, range of devices, and use cases, if we didn’t have an open spectrum that everybody could use.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>At the end of the day, it’s good for telecoms as well. The experiments may fail, but at the end of the day, the telecoms are best equipped to scale out those innovations. They have to go back and talk to telecoms if they want to expand it everywhere.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You even have a good spectrum policy in-place. You got it. You got a really nice package. I would definitely look more into this. I’m actually thinking, if you don’t mind, is it possible for me also to use the transcript to send to people interested in Germany?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We relinquish the copyright. As soon as you’re done editing it, you just put it...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I saw you’re also using open licenses. What’s is it called, CC licenses?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>CC0, actually, for our transcripts.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>It would be a little bit difficult for you to check, because to reach more people in Germany, and especially people also in government, it might be worth translating it into German. I will talk with my colleague.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>If they, after they look at it, think it’s interesting enough, whether we could translate it into German.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>My interview with Julia Kloiber is <a href="https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-10-10-interview-with-ding-magazine">available online</a> and please feel free to translate it to German as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I think her magazine, if I remember, I think that was in English.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah, but my part is open to translation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You have an even more difficult change. German and English are more similar than English and Chinese. We always have this conversation in our organization about putting stuff out, whether in German or in English.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>We have also a lot of international organizations, stakeholders interested in the work. We also want to, one of our core goals, really, is also to advance the conversation and in Berlin, and to reach certain communities. Even in Germany, there’s still a language barrier if you don’t have it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Now, with technology and automated translation, I hope that we are just a couple of years away from having really, really good transcripts, even for, as you know, especially for our topics, where it gets very technical. The automated translation often still fails. It’s not good enough.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s already time-saving. It saves me at least 50 percent of time. I just need to correct a few words after automated translation. As I said, any improvement is a good improvement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Have you been to Germany?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yes, I have.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Where did you visit?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I lived in Germany for a year and few months when I was 10 years old, in Saarbrücken in Dudweiler. My dad was pursuing PhD in the Saarbrücken university. I stayed a year or so, and attending a primary school.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You speak some German?</p>

          <p>That’s great.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If you translate, I am happy to read it aloud again.</p>

          <p>Practice my German.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I also wanted to invite you, you definitely have to come back. It has been so many years. If you are interested in coming, I would love to host you for a conversation with our community. I’ll definitely also talk to people in the environmental organizations and social innovation space.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>There’s a lot of discussion in Germany around social innovation. I don’t know if Julia told you about this. I’ve been talking with her about this, too. There’s some discussion whether we should create something like NESTA in Germany, like an innovation agency, for social innovation, because Prototype Fund has some of that, but there’s obviously the question of whether you want to scale up something that you have, or whether we need something new. One of the problems in Germany is that we’re creating more and more and more things.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>The challenge for it, it needs to be integrated, and it needs to have access to the government. If you have just a social innovation agency, and it’s not really integrated into government thinking and bureaucracy thinking, it will not reach its full impact.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>I think you have a lot to say about these topics, and a lot of interesting examples also regarding the processes to give. If I can interest you to come to Germany, that would be really, really, really excellent. I also find it very important that people also learn that Chinese innovation, all these technologies, is more diverse than just what’s happening on the mainland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>There are other approaches on how to think about this. You have tons of great examples. I think that would be very stimulating for the conversation that we are currently having in Germany.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The cofounder of PDIS, of this office, Shu Yang Lin, as well as one of our main facilitator, Fang-Jui, they are both going to be based in the UK for most of this year. Fang-Jui is going to work closely with Dark Matter Labs, too.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>They’re colleagues of yours from here that are going to UK?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>You can also put me in touch with them. I can reach out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s a shorter flight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>From London, it’s a shorter flight. If you, for other reasons, happen to come to Europe, and you want to add a stop-over in Berlin, please get in touch. It would be an honor for us to have you there, and to bring more of your experience and knowledge into the conversation in Germany.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>Then I have a final request that my wife asked me. She asked me to take a picture with you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>OK, let’s take a picture.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Stefan Heumann">
          <p>She and I might use it for social media.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>No problem at all.</p>
