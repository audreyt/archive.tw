                        …pretty good.

                    <p>
                        Thank you for taking the time to talk. It’s a nice moment to catch up. I invited some friends. Jayne Engle is here. You and Jayne have crossed paths, Audrey, at the Civic Experimentation Workshop that we hosted in Toronto with Indy Johar and Dark Matter Labs.
                    </p>

                        Not only that, so that one was virtual. That was the RegX that…

                <speech by="#Jayne Eagle">
                    <p>
                        Exactly. With Audrey, we did meet very briefly in person in Toronto when you were at Mars giving a talk with Alex Ryan on Taiwan.

                    <p>
                        Yes.

                    <p>
                        That super briefly in person. You gave a talk that touched me so much, I still remember it [laughs] very well. It’s lovely to connect directly.

                    <p>
                        Thank you. Missed you, too. What time is it? Are you in Taipei?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I am in Taipei. This is 7:00 AM. It’s fine. First session of the day.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        You had mentioned that you were doing some transformation within the government over the past month. There was a congressional hearing. Is that right?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah. There’s an Open Parliament Action Plan. It’s not directly me. Mostly, you can say it’s inspired by me. [laughs] The point is that even though we’re in the administration, we do, through the publication of our National Action Plan open government, have the support from the MPs.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s quite rare because all the four major parties in Taiwan’s legislature are through their way behind the Open Parliament Plan, making it truly a cross partisan thing, which is very rare, I tell you. [laughs]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s pretty good. They have also a set of very concrete promises of structured data, of more accessibility and inclusion in the more rural areas to the hearing process, and many more. Quite happy about that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        It’s interesting that the plan is so aligned with the agenda that you’ve been building. I’m curious what you think caused such a groundswell political change in that direction?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In my previous talks, I talked about the Sunflower Movement. How after 2014 it became quite clear to all politicians that if they do not accord to the open government agenda, they don’t get elected as mayors, or any other candidates. That’s the main point. That’s one.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The second reason that I would chalk it up to the support front of Korea Public Service. Right after Sunflower, around end of 2014, I gave a workshop with three batches, each 100 people, of the most senior level of Korea Public Service. They’re unanimously in support of better listening skill methodologies, because otherwise the parliament would get occupied again.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The point is that with the outside game and with the demonstrators showing, as in demoing, the demonstration that it’s actually quite possible for the career public service to reduce the risks, save time, and build mutual trust. Many of them are on board.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That really paid off last year, when we using this digital social innovation framework fought the pandemic rather successfully with no lockdown. That associated infodemic was no take down. The career public service has bought even more into it.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        The three pillars that you mentioned are interesting: reduce risk, save time, and build trust.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        That seems to be an incontrovertible set of goals.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In that order. We never trade one for the other. It’s always easier to reduce risk. For example, I will say in a Presidential Hackathon anyone’s idea is equally good. It’s OK to fail early. It’s easy to say that, but designing the Presidential Hackathons so that many career public servant can propose something anonymously or through their social sector, friends and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If it fails, they would just say, “Oh, I went to a hackathon supporting the citizens idea.” If it did work, then it’s the President giving the trophy with the projector projecting the President, promising whatever you did in the past three months.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Five teams each year become Presidential promises, that’s to say the executive order staff. That changes their career immediately. If they fail, they could always say, “Oh, it’s Audrey’s fault,” which is what my service is mostly about.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One thing that Nigel Jacob, at Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, always talks about is “being greedy with blame and being generous with grace, with credit.” It sounds like that’s very much what you’re describing. If anything goes wrong, you just raise your hand and say…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I apologize and say we’ll fix it next Thursday.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        I appreciate that. It’s really interesting as an approach to accountability in government. I’m curious, what is the scope of technologies or digital services that you’re playing with right now?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        As in what? As in people engaged? As in the number of developers, number of visitors?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        No, I mean more like how much is up for grabs, in a way? When you and I had last spoken, it was the early days of the pandemic. You were talking about open digital infrastructure for real time mask availability. That was very pandemic-specific, and it was a new service, so it stands to reason that it was something you could really have a strong hand in.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Mask availability, and that’s bloomed. When we talked, it was mostly about pharmacies distributing the masks. Then the 24 hour convenience store going on the pre ordering, the app, the national health insurance app, that people downloaded just skyrocketed. It’s the top one downloaded app last year in both app stores.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        More than five million, maybe six million people have used it not only to pre order mask. Also, once they have sufficient supply, they could refrain from collecting the ration. For example, if I stop collecting for two weeks, I have 10 rationed quota that I didn’t use, I can use the app to dedicate that for International Humanitarian Aid in exchange for NFT ish stuff for public acknowledgement. Again, sharing the credit.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        To date, there’s more than eight million masks dedicated this way in more than 750,000 citizens and have let them choose to publish their name.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        This is terrifically interesting. It’s a scope of technology that became available in the moment of the pandemic. Obviously, before the pandemic we weren’t thinking that much about mask and PPE production. Then this became a terrain that was up for grabs because of the moment of the crisis. I wonder now, in so many ways, Taiwan is in latter days of the pandemic.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We’re post pandemic for 10 months, give or take, but yes.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        Building on all of the work that you’ve done and the thesis that you’ve proven in the moment of the pandemic, what is now up for grabs in this open government, digital hackathon space? Are you actually saying healthcare delivery broadly, hack away, or is it…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, there’s a lot of that. As I mentioned, we say installation base of more than five million, it really changed the game. Because, previously, people wasn’t in the habit of downloading their X ray or CT scans or measurements to mint a zero knowledge range proof that any host of a marathon can check out their entrants are healthy without having any access to their private health data.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s the VK part of the zero knowledge. Or that the SDK, the software development kit, of the NHI also enables people to build their own data coalitions. There’s a very popular one with people with diabetes. There’s also one with people who are outdoors who choose to receive notification when there’s a potential of heat damage because of extreme weather.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The app also is a Pokémon GO like app, where it shows the drinking fountains that you can take your bottles and refill nearby and collect points and redeem them for local social enterprise products and build a zero waste and zero plastic lifestyle after 50 days. Among other things, it’s a multipurpose app.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        All this is as a result of Presidential Hackathon and as a result of people’s renewed imagination of the health care so that it’s not just about Medicare. It’s also about preventative medicine. It’s also about immunity and public health. This year, we’re also starting to use the same app, so that you can show the QR code. The IC card for national health care was a physical IC card.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, we’re also checking with the possibilities of scanning over remote telemedicine by just showing a one time QR code and so on. I would say the imagination has been opened.

                    <p>
                        Jayne, please jump in. I want you to share as much as you can. Jayne’s speaking so much about civic imagination. I’ve learned so much from Jayne about what that sphere of possibility is.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Jayne Eagle">
                    <p>
                        Can I ask a quick question on that? I’m super curious, Audrey, because you talk about imagination. One of the things that we’re finding is that we’re still…I’m based here in Canada, in Montreal. We’re very much in the liminal space of the pandemic. An advantage that this liminal space has is imagination. I feel like we’re still in this liminal space where imagination is stronger.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Jayne Eagle">
                    <p>
                        I worry that when we’re post pandemic, there will be less scope for imagination. I’m wondering, given that you’re post pandemic, have you seen that play out in either direction?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This is a great and almost philosophical question. In the parts where the government did not do any top down, or lockdown, or shutdown, or take down during the pandemic, the imagination space has been freed. It’s still certainly growing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The point I want to take is that when the government take a harsh top down action by necessity, of course, it decimates, literally cut down by 10 percent. Every time the government does something like that, the social sector suffers because there’s less agency for the social sector to express itself.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In Taiwan, because we had a heuristic of no lockdowns and takedowns, we had a heuristic of no new code, new data collection points inventing during the pandemic by the government.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

                        We have this idea of social sector first, participatory self surveillance, people public private partnership, which means the social sector has to come up with most of the solutions. That means that imagination space is understood, is what I’m saying.

                        This is exactly it, Audrey. This is truly the basis of why I wanted to talk today. We had talked during this moment of the early days of the pandemic. Now, there’s this disparity. You’re post pandemic. Many of us, especially in the United States or Canada, we’re still mid pandemic.

                        The crisis, the pandemic, cracked open the door of the status quo, in both good and bad ways. It was a moment of exception. There were all sorts of crazy intrusions into personal privacy, but it also allowed us to imagine in new ways. That moment was generative, problematic, and interesting.

                        Now, how do we stick with and act on all the imagination that emerged? What’s the possibility space of actual transformative politics or transformative economics, today? So much of what existed before the pandemic is clearly not something we want to replicate, or it’s not going to work anymore. Real property economics are out the window, for example. Now that you are further in the future, post-pandemic, can you describe the possibility space of action?

                        Yes. We do have a indigenous section in the open government’s National Action Plan, and in our bilateral, with say, New Zealand, the ANZTEC, the Taiwan New Zealand’s relationship has a separate track of indigenous to indigenous relationships, and moderated by either’s governments.

That way it can be abstracted and transposed and re adapted in any context. For example, I’m not copying the mask initiative that you did and pasting it in the United States, but I’m learning from it and contributing to it and re adapting, based on the metadata on conditions in Taiwan and conditions in the US.

                        Don’t let me put words in your mouth, Audrey, but if you can recognize those rights, and tie them to this broader package including the right to sue, and recognize that the city has jurisdiction over certain, let’s say, functions that infringed on some of these other rights, like the right to regenerate, the right to flow, then perhaps you could tie it over to the right to sue and exert legal power back against the city.

                        It feels like we’re still far from that, although the fact that it’s far from a city, but there is a river that has this personhood in another part of the country far away, but we have the city recognizing the Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which isn’t the same thing, but it’s there.

                        We also have a situation where cities have very little power here. Municipalities have very little power here. They’re creatures of provinces in terms of fiscal and any other kinds of jurisdictional powers that they have very little. There are no cities here who have recognized rights of nature.

                        I mentioned in my previous talks where people, especially primary schoolers, contributed to the environmental sensing projects through measuring, say, PM2.5 or other qualities of nature and writing to distributed ledger to build this common sensing framework at a time in 2015 where the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, still only had less than 100 measurement points.

                        The civic society already have more than 2,000. Nowadays, it’s tens of thousands. That builds a much closer solidarity with the nature, because chances are an average citizen will trust a nearby primary school teacher and the class of data steward and data competence learners rather than a random sensor from the EPA hundreds of kilometers away.

                        That’s built a momentum into it. That led to, for example, referenda about cutting back coal burning, I believe, to reduce not just carbon footprint but also reduce PM2.5. Then the referendum was successful.

                        This is a good question. The governance part, it’s easier. Usually, we do this through a multi stakeholder forum. We already had a pretty good example to look up to, which is the impact assessment for agenda that’s been around for more than 12 years in Taiwan and which ultimately led to marriage equality, among other great things.

                        In a very humble beginning, it’s very similar because it’s a bunch of civil society leaders realizing that the government must institutionalize support of gender mainstreaming without encroaching on the agency of the civil society.

                        For us, this is because the underlying infrastructure worth investing as is already there. Since 2016, we’ve classified this thing as a forward looking infrastructure and upended [laughs] our National Audit Office internal rules because previously intangible things can’t qualify as infrastructure but we changed that anyway.

                        To get to that place, there’s no shortcut, but if you can divert one percent, as we used to say, in 2016, one percent of the total national budget and invest in this infrastructure, treating something like this map as worth doing as a national park, then you’ll be on the right path.

If both jurisdictions recognized that was investigating in joint ventures into digital public infrastructure, it doesn’t compete directly with Facebook in terms of mindshare, but it sends a very clear signal saying that we want our town halls, our public deliberations to take place in public parks, in libraries, and other digital equivalent of public infrastructure.
