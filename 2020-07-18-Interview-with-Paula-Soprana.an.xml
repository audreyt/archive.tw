                    2020-07-18 Interview with Paula Soprana
                </heading>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Do you record all interview with the press?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Not necessarily. If you publish as video, I can also publish as video, in which case there’s no transcript. But if you’re just writing in text, then most journalists find it easier if we make a transcript and publish that instead. It’s your choice.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Is the transcription automatic?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s augmented. Of course, if we upload the video to YouTube, YouTube automatically make a transcript. If you’re going to make a formal transcript, then we also run it through humans that make, necessarily, edits.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        I see. Is this part of an open government policy?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes, indeed. We have this visitor protocol. Maybe you have already seen this. It spells out when, where, why, and how we make such transcripts. I’ve pasted a link to you.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Cool. Can you point out other government transparency measures based in Taiwan like this one?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Like what?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Like this one to share all the interviews, which other measures…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Definitely. For example, I’m currently in the Social Innovation Lab, which is a park. We tore down the walls. Because of that, it’s very accessible. Every Wednesday, from 10:00 AM to evening, anyone can just walk in, knock my door, and have 10 minutes to 40 minutes of my time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Again, if they agree that we make a video or the transcript available online so that they will lobby for the public interest not for only their private interests because that wouldn’t look very well in the public transcript or video. That is also very accessible.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For people who cannot travel to Taipei that easily, I also tour around Taiwan. I just returned from Taichung this early morning to work with people locally and also conference in, through video conference, people in the central government.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        I want to start asking how do you describe yourself politically?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I’m a lower-case minister.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        I know. No, I mean like you are individualist, anarchist?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I’m a lower-case minister, with a small m. I’m not a upper-case Minister. As a digital minister, lower-case, I communicate, advocate, preach sometimes, and write poems.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You think of me not as a top-down, like order-giving minister, but rather just someone who serves as a channel between the various different positions in order to find common values, more like a chat room moderator than anything.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        I was talking about like do you have a civic…You were a civic hacker for a long time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I still am.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, you are. I want to understand a little bit more about, how do you define yourself as a non-anarchist to stuff like, I want to know this concept.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s conservative anarchist, important distinction. Being a conservative, I conserve all the cultures. For example, in Taiwan, there’s more than 20 national languages, each representing a culture.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Instead of sacrificing the values of various indigenous and new cultures in the name of progress on any particular culture, I work transculturally to make innovations that respect the dignity of their various cultures in a transcultural way. That’s the conservative part.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The anarchist part means that I don’t give orders. I don’t receive orders. I don’t believe in coercion. I work with voluntary association, and people who want to work through this method, I work with them. People who don’t want to work with this method, I don’t force them.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        This will be OK. Taiwan had a different approach on coronavirus, and that explains why you’re now in a post-pandemic moment.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For quite a few weeks now. Actually, we’ve been basically over by end of April or so.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Wow, it’s a long time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, it’s a long time. We’re firmly in a post-pandemic.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        What was the whole technology in this area to avoid the spread of the virus? Can you talk a little bit about those actions?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course. The most important technology in fighting the coronavirus is chemical. It’s called soap, like washing hands properly. That’s the most important, and alcohol hand spray, sanitation, temperature checks. These are also very important.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I’m referring to the mask as physical vaccine. The message is if you wear a mask, it protects you from your own unwashed hands. It’s a reminder for you to wash your hands more thoroughly, and also a reminder for other people to also wash their hands more thoroughly. These are the most important technologies. The quarantine hotels, of course, helped a lot for everybody returning to Taiwan.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We asked them to stay in the quarantine hotel for 14 days most of the time, but if they have a large space to live in their own home, if they have their own bathroom and do not live with people who are very vulnerable to the Coronavirus, they can also choose home quarantine, in which case their home is put into the digital fence, in the sense that the cellphone towers triangulate the positions of the phone.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        They are already doing that anyway, but if the phone breaks out of the 50 meters or so radius, an SMS is sent to the local household manager and police to track people’s whereabouts if their phone runs out of battery or breaks out of the digital fence. One way or another, it’s just to ensure that there’s a 14-day quarantine for people returning home so that the rest of the society can live in a common collective fashion.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Can you describe to me the system of masks and the map?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes, of course. It’s already a given in Taiwan that people are using map-based technology and their own measurement stations to track, for example, air pollution, and also water pollution levels, and so on. We repurposed that civic sector technology for the distribution of masks in pharmacies.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s not a government idea. It’s a civic technologist in Hainan inventing this way of people reporting where has masks and where does not. We ensure that we trust the citizens radically with an open API so that after a couple of days of Howard Wu, Wu Chang-Wei inventing this technology, we made sure that we supply him and everybody else, more than 100 teams developing the availability mask map, with the real-time data.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Every 30 seconds, we refresh the availability level of children’s masks, of adults’ masks of all the pharmacies in Taiwan, and so people can very easily, even if they have conditions like blindness, they can also use a voice assistant or they can use a chatbot and so on to get the remaining stock of the pharmacies that’s closest to them, and go there and swipe their NHI – the National Health Insurance – card.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If they are an adult, collect 9 medical masks for a very low price, and if they are a child, they can collect 10 medical masks for every two weeks.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Once they do, after a while, just a couple of minutes, they can see on the map or chatbot that actually, the level of the stock depletes by 9 or 10 in that pharmacy. There’s participatory accountability. People don’t have to blindly believe the government or populations. People can check for themselves. Anybody visiting a pharmacy will check for themselves that this technology is actually working, and everything is accountable.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We are now using the same technology to display the availability of the Triple Stimulus Vouchers. The Triple Stimulus Vouchers, again, are distributed not in pharmacies this time, but rather in post offices, where you can also see where the post offices are and in real-time how much Triple Stimulus Vouchers do they still have for purchase, and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s using exactly the same API. Again, there is a multitude of people implementing such maps and so on. I just pasted you such a map. Again, just like pharmacies, the post office workers can just press a key and say, “OK, I’m closed for the day,” in which case they disappear from the map as a green dot.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        Can we adopt that in Brazil?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Very easily. South Korean people, their civic technologists there, used this map to convince their own government when they’re rationing the medical mask. Our implementation was in February, I think. By March, the Korean people convinced their government to do the same, using the same API.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The first rationing strategy brought out in Korea was also through pharmacies. The first map that works in South Korea was coded by someone in Taiwan. Finjon Kiang [Mandarin] from Tainan provided the first map for the Korean people. Even though he doesn’t speak Korean, he speaks JavaScript.

                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        You also have a strategy against disinformation on COVID, right?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes, called “humor over rumor.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Paula Soprana">
                    <p>
                        How does it work?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Very easily. Whenever people share a disinformation, a rumor that has a high r-value, that is to say each person shares to two or three more people…Maybe it travels on outrage, like panic buying, maybe get trades of fear, like various conspiracy theories about coronavirus.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Whenever we detect such a high r-value, because Taiwan is a liberal democracy, we don’t do administrative takedown. We cannot take down these messages. By the way, the takedown doesn’t really work, like lockdown, unless you do it in a very strict fashion, like taking down pretty much everything.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        A takedown deprives the civil society of the opportunity of learning from each other, so we don’t do takedown. Instead, we debunk the myths, like a “Mythbuster,” but in a way that’s really funny. We use memes, that is to say, funny pictures, and make sure that we roll out a funny picture a couple hours, at most, after each trending rumor.

                        For example, when the tissue paper, it was panic buying because there is a rumor that says we’re ramping up the mask production from 2 million a day to 20 million a day. It’s the “same material as tissue paper,” so they are going to run out soon, so people panic buy.

                        Within a couple hours, our premier, Su Tseng-chang, roll out this funny picture, wiggling his bottom a little bit. That says, “Each of us only have one pair of buttocks.” Basically, it means that it doesn’t make sense to stockpile tissue paper because stockpile and butt sounds the same in Mandarin. Anyway, it’s a pun.

                        People laugh about it a lot because the premier made himself the butt of a joke. Then the meme has a table that says the material for tissue paper came from the South American pulp material, while the medical masks are actually plastic products. They came from domestic materials, so ramping up production doesn’t hurt the tissue paper production.

                        Because it’s so funny, it maybe has a r-value of five. Each person will share to five people, so very quickly, people get vaccinated against the infodemic virus of the mind. If you feel joy, humor about something, literally, you cannot feel outrage about the same thing.

                        There’s no censorship. They can still freely speculate about tissue paper shortage, but something that is not true – for example, the tissue paper are made out of plastic – that’s just not true. It’s not a fact, scientifically and materially. You can probably try to set it aflame [laughs] and see if tissue paper are made out of plastic.

                        They are included because of digital technology that allows thousands of people to speak to each other and listen to each other, not like radio and television, which would only allow one person to speak to thousands of people. That’s the main difference between open government and previous forms of government. It’s symbiotic with digital technology.

                        We also have a problem of the echo chamber, that’s how you probably call it, in social media. How can government can support other platforms or other ways to engage people with public debates, not only just through Facebook, or WhatsApp, or other big social media?

                        Of course, antisocial media is also social media, I guess. What we are focusing on is prosocial media. That is to say, it’s important to know that the current antisocial media sometimes serves the interests of advertisers or other forms of precision targeting and so on, are not the only way to manage our attention together.

                        If we design spaces to find common ground and create consensus, collective intelligence, we don’t have to fall victims to the echo chamber. As I mentioned, the Taiwanese equivalent of Reddit, the PTT, is not a corporation. It’s just a computer club, really, by the National Taiwan University. It’s thoroughly in the not-for-profit sector. They don’t sell advertisement and indeed do anything that’s resembles the business.

                        The point here is that if you have a media that serve the people instead of serving particular interest groups, then you’re much likely to get design patterns that encourage people, instead of attacking each other, they can contribute to the opinions and ideas.

                        You see that there is no reply button, for example. There is not nested threats on PTT or on the Join platform of e-petition. You have pro column of comments, con column of comments, but they are not allowed to reply to each other. You can only upload and download.

                        Just by simple ideas of social interaction design, you can very easily reflect the true situation to people, which is most people agree with most of the things proposed by most of their neighbors most of the time. It’s just the divisive antisocial media over-concentrates on a few controversies or ideologies, which may be good to keep people’s attention on their platform and sell advertisements, but is detrimental to the society overall.

Of course, people have different feelings, and it’s all OK. You can feel happy. They can feel angry. The idea is to share our feelings to find the common ideas that resonates with everybody, that everybody can live with.

                        Because both my parents were journalists, out of filial piety, I cannot use the F word. We use the word instead, disinformation. It has a legal definition, which is untrue messages that was spread intentionally to cause public harm. This is very precise definition. If it’s unintentional, it’s not disinformation. It’s just misinformed. If it’s not causing public harm but just harming the image of a minister, that’s just good journalism. [laughs]

                        The point I’m making is that if it’s intentional, harmful to the public, untrue message, we don’t do an administrative takedown. Rather, we specifically call out that and do a public notice, a notice in public saying that this is intentionally spread. We work with the fact checkers who will prove that it’s actually untrue and intentionally spread.

                        Definitely Line. It’s an end-to-end encrypted channel like WhatsApp. The state cannot look into the content of the message. There is many bots like the Trend Micro bot, Dr.Message, which is based on the idea from another g0v project called CoFacts.

                        Dr.Message, which I pasted you, is an all-purpose bot, which is also in the form of a cute dog that you can forward anything that you suspect is spam, or scam, or disinformation to the bot, and the bot checks that and gets back to you whether it’s a scam or not.

It’s still in the junk mail box. If you have too much time, you can check your junk mail folder, but not many people do that.

                        We call it a platform economy, which, again, has a very precise definition. The idea here is that platform economy is, of course, mechanisms designed by platforms, Internet platforms, that mediates between providers on one side and people who use these services on the other side, and the platform determines the rules.

                        Where we are saying is that if the platform is transparent, is a mere conduit, it merely forwards messages both ways, instead of monopolizes the data flow, then it’s just like a chat room, in which case the platform itself can operate mutually.

                    <p>
                        As soon as the platform starts to capture the value, for example, to do its own dispatch, hiding the provider information from the requesters and so on, then the platform is engaging in the trade of a platform that’s the same as providers, in which case they need to be regulated the same way.

                        For example, Uber and Uber Eats is registered as a local Taiwanese company. They operate their own taxi fleet, the Q-TAXI fleet. They obey exactly the same rules as other taxis. They say, “But we want to offer surge pricing, which is a better price when there is more demand.”

                        Of course, you can do that, and through Polis, people say other taxi companies need to be able to use that too. Every other taxi company can also do surge pricing, but they cannot evade their duties to set up a taxi company. They cannot evade their duties of doing insurance and a professional credential for the drivers.

                        I don’t think people care really. Taiwan has been, of course, very liberal for LGBTQIA+ communities. I think Dr. Tsai Ing-wen also a very good example, because she I think is the only woman leader in Asia that is a president by merit, instead of because she is in any political family or whether she has connections through her father or her husband.

                        I don’t think being transgender poses a challenge for me working as a minister. I think in Taiwan, we are very much gender mainstreamed. Not only we have legalized marriage equality, but actually, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen became president not because she is the wife or daughter of any one political family or things like that. People just enter parliament and see more than 40 percent of legislators are women.

                        It’s just not a big deal. Personally, I think being transgender also enables me to become more transportal, and that I can empathize with various different people. I don’t have this binary duality in my mind. I wouldn’t say half of the population is different from me, so it’s easier for me to take all the sides.
