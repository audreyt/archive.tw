                    2019-08-26 Interview with Chinasa Chukwu

                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        My name’s Chinasa. I’m the co-founder and art director of Postscript. Postscript is a cultural anthology that’s focused on exploring the complexities of modern women of culture.

                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        What that essentially means is, we share stories from different parts of the globe from contemporary women in different industries that we find really inspiring. Predominantly, those are women in either the creative industries or the cultural industries, or women of note, changing the societal landscape – of which you are one, which is why we wanted to interview you.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        I have read some of your interviews. I’ve seen that some of them are quite focused on the technology and technical aspects of your work. We’re going to take a slightly more holistic approach to it, so your journey to where you are, and then how you found implementing new policies and particularly your work with digital transparency and social innovation. Is that OK? Do you have any questions?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, I just posted you a link by Dumbo Feather magazine and that is one of the more personal ones, again, because we make a transcript and/or record everything. Therefore, the transcript is also in the public domain and you are free to use any of the material there.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        OK, thank you so much. That’s so helpful. Oh, nice, OK. All right. We’ll just start with more of a get to know you section. Going back to leaving high school, what was it in particular about the digital space? I know you left as quite a young teenager. What was it about the digital space that you saw that made you feel so strongly about it that you wanted to leave high school to focus on being yourself?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sure. I encountered this website called Archive.org and that’s ARXIV, and it’s a preprint website meaning that people who post their journal papers to the peer review. Before it gets published, they post it to their Internet for people to discuss. Because I was doing a science fair project when I was 14 working on nowadays, it would be called artificial intelligence and natural language processing so I had to consult a lot of those preprint papers.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Now, I remember distinctly telling my principal at the time that instead of going through the university, college, post-doc, and so on, I actually wrote emails to the leading researchers of that field asking them questions, asking for clarifications and so on, and they all replied very kindly.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Now they didn’t know that I was 14 years old, they didn’t know that my English was not that good at all. It took me ages to compose that email and so on to them and just a fellow researcher. Because of this, a landscape opens before me instead of going through the high institutional process to take 10 years or more to get into their lab. I feel that I am in their lab already and we’re actually doing productive work together.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I remember my principal hearing that story and thought about it for a minute and said, “OK, from tomorrow on you don’t have to go to school anymore, and I’ll cover for you.” This is actually very happy story in that instill in me a certain optimism to the flexibility of bureaucracy.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        Oh my gosh, that’s amazing. That was actually my next question, was what it that also convinced your teachers to allow you to go and do this, but you just explained that. Carrying on from that, do you think that in any way, just moving things forward a bit, do you think that kind of experience you had was part of the inspiration for focusing so strongly on transparency, and having this really open, collaborative process with citizens and within the digital space?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Certainly, without which I wouldn’t have the education. I remember reading gothic classics from the Gutenberg Project, and the Gutenberg Project, as you may know, digitizes everything, all the classics that’s published before the first World War at the time, because they have fallen out of copyright.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        After that copyright gets extended quite a few times, and we only got a new release of material only in the past couple years. During my kind of self-education, I read a lot of classics but they were all written before the first World War, because everything else is still copyrighted.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think that also instilled in me a certain optimism, because I haven’t read the things that written after World War, which tend to be more dystopic and pessimistic. But in any case, what I am getting into, is that without this volunteer social sector, that opens up the classics and at the time there’s no good optical character recognition.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People actually have to type them by hand to digitize everything and published it for everybody to peer review and use without these diligent people working in the volunteering and social sectors, it wouldn’t be even possible for me to have a liberal arts education by my own on the Internet, it was like my friends to have something to discuss.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course, afterwards, there’s Wikipedia, the Wiki Sources, and the whole open access movement, so nowadays the children don’t have to rely on Gutenberg Project alone, but the time for me was really transformational.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Chinasa Chukwu">
                    <p>
                        That’s amazing, thank you. Going back a little bit more now, how did you get involved in hacking?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I started programming when I was eight years old, and I started without a program, machine, that is to see I learned programming as mathematics. I just had some programming books on the bookshelf, I think from my uncles, and I just started reading it.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I was pretty good at mathematics, but I really isn’t that good at calculation, it’s never been my forte, so I learned about this machine that can automate all the calculations, but leaving the mathematic, the creative part of mathematics to human beings.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We didn’t have computers at the time, so I just took A4 paper and split it in half, and drew on the button half a keyboard, a QWERTY keyboard, and started mock typing it and writing the computer’s responses and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course, after a couple month my parents kind of gave in and bought me a personal computer. I always remember programming without computer. It kind of what we’re saying today is called computational thinking.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You can learn computational thinking without a computer, just like you can design thinking without being a professional designer. That is just a kind of habit of the mind, so that’s how I learned program when I was eight years old, that was 1989.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So considering that you didn’t finish high school, and you taught yourself all these processes, how did you get your first job in Silicon Valley? What was that process like?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I participated in the free software movement really early on. I happened to be visiting Silicon Valley when the open source movement began. Open source is kind of a rebranding of the free software movement.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When I was in Taiwan, I’m already kind of maintainer of many Perl, the computer language of the early Web, many Perl applications and I also contributed a local Perl community on Usenet which is a forum system. In any case, with that experience, I’ve always felt at home at these voluntary communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I was visiting Silicon Valley in ‘90, I think it was ‘98 or something, there was this new movement to convince large corporations like Netscape to open up its source code. That would later on become Firefox.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        To open up its source code, and not for altruistic purposes, but rather for commercial purposes, because it makes it easier to maintain. It makes it easier to look at their cybersecurity profile and have volunteer, essentially users were also abusers, to help making things better, improve on things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There was this whole movement of pushing free software for economic not a ethical or social perspective. That’s how I got involved in Silicon Valley, just by talking with my free software friends that they were online, but at the same time, they were beginning to get jobs from traditional commercial companies.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I remember first doing just consultancy work, just fixing up documentations, just patching up their issues and one of my first work is to provide Traditional Chinese, to Simplified Chinese translation software.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That was kind of my domain knowledge anyway, I work in search engine in my first start-up in ‘95, so I just contributed whatever I learned at the time into the CPAN, which is a comprehensive Perl archive network.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I guess job just found me, because I published over a hundred reusable software components on CPAN, and I got thank you emails from the likes of BBC, or from the likes of the Human Genome Project, and things like that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They are all part of this Perl community anyway, so when they want some contractual work, some consultancy work, or internationalization work like bringing their product to a Chinese-speaking community, they will contract my company to do so.

                    <p>
                        Do you feel like, considering you were involved in this earlier movement to get commercial companies to create more open source, or make their software open source, and have it be something now a little bit more collaborative, do think that in any way has influenced your current at this instant? Has it helped? Has it made a difference in the way that you liaise between the government and the people?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Very much so. When I was working with the Silicon Valley companies, I’m not really working for them, right, at exactly the same point it’s like as you said a liaison or as I prefer to call it a branch point between the two bodies, between the movement and the government currently.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We had very different challenges alongside the different 20 years or more of open source movement. First, is just to get the idea out, the advocacy work. Very soon, when we do have some good examples such as Red Hat Linux, and the Mozilla browser, which later on become Firefox and so on, to convince the internal bureaucracy of large companies such as Microsoft to make them kind of drop their fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even when I worked with Apple, it was around the time where Apple seriously considered developing a new programming language called Swift in the open. It means not only opening the software, but also opening the governance, meaning that it really let people participate where the language is going, even if you’re not running on Apple hardware.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Which at that time, is actually maybe even harder than advocacy in Microsoft, because it really wasn’t in Apple’s DNA at the time. Eventually, the people in the open source movement succeeded on both fronts.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Swift is now open governance and used on lots of things beyond the Apple ecosystem, and Microsoft now runs GitHub, of all things. I think the success stories gave us a wide-range of playbook to interact with different levels in the bureaucracy to convince them of the benefits of openness based on their own flow of work, not some outside/in, top/down command relationship.

                        That’s true, the first openly transgender minister and the world’s first digital minister. Have you found that that’s affected your work in any way, whether that be your approach to the work, or working with people? Has that made a difference at all?

                    <p>
                        Very much so. I think having gone through two puberties, really helped the communication, because my mind has various different lived-in experiences that corresponds to people’s different stages in their adolescence, so it means that my range of understanding just the resolution meaning that the finer detail of emotions, of following each other’s emotional state, empathy, right?

                        Is greatly extended because we happen to share somewhat similar living experiences, whether your gender, or whether your preferred gender expression, or your gender identity, and so on. Also, even more importantly, it gave me a perspective of intersectionality. Meaning that although I do have my privileged positions, I also have my vulnerable lived-in experiences.

                    <p>
                        That is true for other advocates that I met, they may be suffering from some social injustice which I can relate with my experience of vulnerability of discriminated against, of transphobia, and things like that, but also can share how I managed to label those internal states and make them into empowering experiences that can be turned into not just personal anger, but social outrage that unifies people rather than divides people.

                        Then do you feel like, again, by being in this position, do you feel like there’s any added pressure, because you have to maybe represent anybody that is coming from that kind of vulnerable position as well? Would you feel like that pressure doesn’t exist?

                        It’s definitely true that Taiwan is especially inclusive and tolerant. We are, after all, the first Asian country that has marriage equality. This is not a coincidence, because we’ve been for the past 12 years, doing what we call gender impact assessment to every single policy and every single draft bill that’s 200 policies per year, and 20 or so draft bills per year.

                        Every public servant is required to fill in those gender impact assessment to every single thing that they do, even unrelated to gender, and have the CSO, the Civil Society leaders independently to review them. Our gender equality committee is designed so they have exactly one more seat than the government ministers. So maybe 16 ministers and 17 CSO experts.

                        They review each and every thing that they write. They correct the misconceptions, and they make new measurements and we put them into the gender statistics dashboard, whenever a new policy happens.

                        The indicators we watch is very comprehensive, and then we make series of changes based on the raw numbers, so that we can know that with each policy introduced are we empowering women, are we empowering people in disadvantaged positions, or are we contributing to patriarchy or some other kinds of systemic discrimination, and we know it through evidence not just through imagination of the ministers.

                        Because of this, we would be lost if not for the agenda dashboard, but now with the gender dashboard, and the entire public service doing that for 12 years when the constitutional ruling and the referendum came in, we immediately settled on the way to legalize marriage equality.

                        I think although I may be seen as advocating for next step of gender mainstreaming of what I call post-gender, that it’s built on a feminist movement and on the gender mainstreaming efforts. I have this whole community that is mainstream in the public servants to support me. It’s not like I’m in the minority, literally every public servant in the past 12 years supports my mission.

                        To be a conservative is to respect a tradition. To understand that there are ways that people have honored their ancestors’ ways of doing things for hundreds, or even thousands, or tens of thousands of years.

                        We have more than 15 indigenous nations, and they share the same culture with the entire Polynesian population. The whole Australian nation culture originated from Taiwan, and the culture extends all the way to New Zealand. We have in our New Zealand economic agreement, the NZTech, a separate track for diplomacy between the Maori people and our indigenous people.

                        If I’m not a conservative, in the sense of conserving the tens of thousands of years of western, of our indigenous traditions, it’s very easy to introduce new digital policies that essentially forces everybody to just learn the very resourceful languages and cultures.

                        Yes. That definitely makes sense. I completely understand. Now shifting to radical transparency, just having looked at it and seeing the way the process works, it is something that I find particularly inspiring.

                        I just have a few questions about the way the actual process works. For you, considering that you’re such an advocate for transparency, would you say that there are any, have you found that there are any aspects, that there’s any data that’s off-limits to transparency?

                        Essentially, state secrets, top secrets and so on, I don’t even know about them. That’s my working condition. I just told the National Security Council, “Don’t tell me anything that’s state secret.” [laughs] My principle is that every meeting that I chair, every meeting with a journalist such as you, or a lobbyist, we are making it open but it’s not live-streamed.

                        We only live stream if you’re live streaming. We only do a video record if you are video recording, which for Skype is mutual anyway. Otherwise, we were just publishing a written transcript. Everybody actually gets 10 days to edit the transcript. For example, if you mentioned your friend’s anecdote, that friend may not actually authorize you to publish their story.

                        We respect other people’s privacy, other people’s trade secrets, confidentiality, and so on, and so everybody can edit their own words. I have encountered a journalist that consider, all the questions that she asked is company property. That transcript only has my answers, and all the questions are redacted, but you can infer the questions.

                    <p>
                        In any case, the limit is very flexible. What we’re doing really is to make transparency the default, and make it extra effort to redact, whereas the old bureaucracy is closed by default, and it takes extra effort to be transparent. That’s what I mean by radical transparency. It means transparency at the root. It doesn’t mean transparency in a violent fashion.

                        Carrying on from that, obviously, part of the efforts of transparency is to have more public and civic engagement, and more civic participation. I know it started out being focused on budget matters, but it has extended further. As it continues to extend, are there any decisions that you think maybe shouldn’t be left to the public?

                        For example, in our referendum law, we spell out things that are not to referendum. For example, you cannot take away indigenous rights by a referendum, because indigenous people is maybe three percent or less of the population. If you put it to referendum, they always lose. The idea is not something like that.

                        We call them indigenous nations. The whole point is that it is a semi diplomatic relationship, truth and reconciliation, and all that. It’s not up for a referendum. It’s good if the indigenous people with their own tribal elders, their own ways of governance and so on, engage in a conversation just between state, a diplomatic relationship that includes both sides as an input.

                    <p>
                        It’s a consultative, at most a partnership relationship. It’s never at deciding as in the ethnic Han, overwhelming the population of indigenous nation, and forcing them to accept something because they are the minority. The democratic principle is very simple. If something is systematically in the minority, as defined by intersectionality principles, that should not be put to popular vote.

                        It’s a very simple idea. Also, in our e-participation, we often just set the agenda. It means that we’re not really going to referendum overnight. What we’re really doing is that to get everybody’s piece of the puzzles, of their take on a wicked problem, and then we share the systemic map.

                        We still leave the implementation to the career public servants, and/or the social sector, and/or the private sector. Everybody can commit to the thing that it’s best for them to do, and hold each other accountable. What we’re not doing is that we’re just counting the headcount and say, Oh, this is the private sector. It doesn’t matter. This is the social sector. It doesn’t matter.”

                        In desire thinking terms, to frame the best question of how might we find common values despite different positions, is more important than the decisional stage. If you’re asking the wrong question, no matter what you put to the referendum, the result will be terrible.

                        I think it’s easier if you start with a level of governance that is smaller scale. If you’re just deciding for a local co-op of 200 people, that will be easy because everybody knows everybody, and you already shared the common values. If you start with a township of maybe 20,000 people, many of these tools we use scales very easily to that level.

                        Basically, I think Taiwan is just a larger municipality, geographically speaking. From the north most to the south most through high-speed rail, it’s just one and a half hours. We may have 23 million people, but it’s a really small place, and highest popular density, I think, or second highest.

                        In any case, the point is that if people share similar lived in experiences, you can always start there. In your city council, in your precinct, or even without the public sector, you can just run it in your co-op. This methodology works best if people don’t have to focus on very different lived in experiences, if people already share more or less the same concerns.

                        I think what I’m getting from this, is that you approach policymaking very much from an empathy base, as well as from looking at commonalities. What would you say? I noticed that you added, or that it was added as part of the g0v platform, an emotion ratings added as part of the process. Can you explain to me why you thought that was important?

                        In the old policymaking process, usually people share the facts, public information, open government data and open data from other sectors, and then people will hold some brainstorm meetings to get ideas on how to improve gender dashboard, to propose a series of change.

                        Finally, people would ratify it into decisions that people act collectively. What’s missing here, is that there is no stage for feelings. What we have introduced, and is not originated from Taiwan, it’s invented in Canada, part of the focus conversation method in 2005, is that after objective stage but before the interpretative stage, the ideation stage, they added a stage called reflective space.

                        That is to say, on the same fact, you may feel anxious, I may feel happy. There’s no right or wrong about feelings. If people give ourselves a few weeks, three weeks, four weeks to check each other’s feelings, it actually makes it much easier to brainstorm the ideas.

                        The ideation, always the problem is how do we rank ideas? What ideas are better than others? If two of them are equally feasible but addresses different aspects and they’re mutually exclusive in some way, how do we arbitrate between the ideas? Usually, the criteria is arbitrary.

                        If now we have a stage dedicated to feelings and there’s no right or wrong, first of all, a polity is made by letting people understand, actually, most of the people feel the same about the same thing most of the time. It rebuilds the polity. The second thing is that we can direct ideas. The best ideas are the ones that take care of most people’s feelings.

                        That is an important insight in saying, if we let people share not only their feelings but also reflect on each other’s feelings, we always get better criteria to qualitatively ranked ideas. As a result, we may delay the policymaking for most ourselves, so that we recover this time cost by making people feel better.

                        While expanding on how the process works, because obviously, it’s predominantly an online process, how do you know that the people participating in it are representative of the larger society’s views? Some people are naturally more adept at being online.

                        First of all, what we’re making through our online technology is not we use them to replace face to face meetings. We never do that. For us, online technology is a way to amplify and to connect face-to-face meetings. It always starts with face-to-face meetings. All the collective feeling checking is actually done by face-to-face meetings.

                        We tour around Taiwan to bring technology to people. We’re not asking people to come to technology. You can think of our online part as what’s taking place between two face-to-face meetings. In a face-to-face meeting, we check each other’s facts. We make a handbook of the facts we have proposed.

We want everybody to know about these facts, so we use online platforms to broadcast it. When we’re broadcasting this, what we’re, essentially, asking is not representation. What we’re asking, a re-presentation of what people feel about these issues.

                        Because of that, no matter where you’re holding this face-to-face conversation, it only takes one click using your mobile phone to make it also online. Once you make it also online, the technology kicks in. It can be summarized, put into a mind map, put into a transcript, and so on, ensuring that this conversation not only includes remote participants but is, in fact, archived to become the agenda for the next meeting.

                        10Mbps is really important because 10Mbps enables 1080p. That is just a high definition video. High definition video means that, just as you are now looking at me, I’m looking at you, we can look at each other’s micro-expressions. Meaning that if you look lost or your attention is drifting and so on, I would know intuitively and follow your smile really quickly.

                        If all we have is less than 10Mbps, that is to say, that we only have 480p or 320p, then that means that we are pixelated and none of the micro-expressions are visible. What the brain does if you haven’t met someone and you already know that they are speaking about a topic but you cannot read their micro-expressions, the brain produces a gestalt, meaning that we fill in the details using our imagination just as in your dreams.

                        In our dreams, when we fill those in, it’s almost always wrong because those are internal psychological projections of ourselves. If we see each other as friends, I would project friendly gestures even if you are not doing any friendly gestures and vice versa. That actually hurts trust. It makes trust impossible because, then, all the messages you get are double messages.

                        Many countries judicial branches already work that way. The judicial branch builds its legitimacy by making the educations, the judgments, the rulings, and so on, free of copyright. In many jurisdictions, lawyers cannot claim copyright on their work exactly because it’s a literature not only about the law itself but of how people perceive the law over time. That is to say the norms around the law.

I think it’s only a matter of time for the administrative branch to follow suit but the two branches definitely lead the way.

                        If we have real-time, ready-to-use narratives, and indeed, transcripts of all the policymaking context, then investigative journalists can actually be faster than the content forums in their initial fact-checking and things like that. I think it really motivates more transparency work within a ministry exactly because there’s an adversary that is resourceful, that is as quick as we are, and is very intentioned in sowing discord.

                        In talking about that, especially, as we said, disinformation has become part of the day-to-day social landscape, why do you think, considering that Taiwan has been able to come up with this kind of process of producing counter-narratives, why do you think or do you have any thoughts on why other countries, perhaps, haven’t implemented this as well?

                        The result, of course, is a less informed citizenry, what some jurisdictions consider is a worthwhile trade-off to make. I’m not just talking about the states that are police states or authoritarian states in the beginning. I’m talking about the fellow Indonesian governments that struggle really hard against that impulse and they finally decided that producing counter-narratives is actually more empowering of the citizens.

They’re struggling between the Singaporean model and the Taiwan model because the Singaporean model does have a kind of allure. You can, at the cost of not empowering your general citizenship, easily take down or, at least, correct things and, by the way, also make the opposition party weaker. So, why not? [laughs]

My mission is just to say that the Taiwan model is not only cheaper amortized but also cheaper up-front. It actually takes less energy if you can work with the social sector, who are very much willing to volunteer the fact-checking work and the work spreading the clarifications and so on.

                        I think many governments were unable to do that perhaps because they have less of a mutual trust relationship with the social sector or perhaps, they were wary of empowering the social sector too much. These, too, I think, are the main psychological fear, uncertainty, and doubt but based on my experience working with our nearby jurisdictions, they do come around, which is why I’m optimistic.

                        Like how to transition our energy profile from a linear carbon outputting energy profile to a renewable one, or how do transitional justice across the different cultures including but not unlimited to the indigenous. How to reform our pension fund.

                        The very high level, very difficult, I think the UK people call them wicked problems. The president is not shying away from putting it to national-wide deliberation and debate. I think that set a really good example in saying that if we can survive doing these, there’s no reason why the citizens shouldn’t demand the same of any government that’s afterward.

                        It’s just like in the 2014, the late that year, the mayoral election put everybody who ever cared for open government such as Mayor Ko Wen-je, Mayor Ko Wen-je into mayorship, and put everybody who are advocating for more technocrat or bureaucrat, closed-door meeting of the mayorship and mayors start doing open government work on a smaller scale.

                        They set a standard so that no mayors in this election or the next or the next would retract from that because people are just getting used to participatory policymaking on a city level. What we’re now doing is at an administrative level.

                        OK. Thank you so much. Now, I’m just going to ask some quick fire questions. Well, the first one perhaps not quite as quick fire. What would you say, if anything, has g0v taught you about society as a whole?

                    <p>
                        I joined g0v about half a year after its founding. I think g0v taught me that a simple domain hack that is changed an O to a 0 in the URL is itself a social innovation. A social innovation changes the society by making everybody reimagine some part that were closed to public participation to something that everybody can contribute.

                    <p>
                        It’s social in its input and socially beneficial in its output. We think of social innovation as something grand, something that takes a theory of change, and things like that. Sometimes, it’s just a domain hack. With the domain hack, kind of subliminally people just think, “Oh, if I don’t like the government, I can do better.” That is the origin of the empowerment.

                        I suspend my judgment during the day, and I do all my value cleansing work to find common values to the positions that I have led during the day in the night during my sleep. When I wake up, I always wake up with some new ideas that could unite the different positions that were worrisome in the day because I don’t pass judgment during the day. I just listen to all the sides.

                        Sometimes, I find it difficult to take all the sides so I just put everything to sleep. When I wake up, first I discovered that I can actually take all the sides and second that there is some unifying value. If things are really complicated, if there’s many, many sides, sometimes I overwork and sleep for 9 hours or even 10 hours.
