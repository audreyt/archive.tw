                        Welcome, everyone, to today’s RadicalxChange between Yuval Noah Harari and Audrey Tang. I’m Puja Ohlhaver. I’m very humbled to be part of this conversation. The title of today’s conversation is “To Be or not to Be Hacked? The Future of Identity, Work and Democracy.”

                        Joining me from Israel is Yuval. He is a gay historian and author of three widely popular books which you’ve probably heard of or read. The first one is “Sapiens,” which is a history of our distant past. The second one is “Homo Deus,” which is about our distant future. The most recent book is “21 Lessons for the 21st Century,” which is about today.

                        Also joining me is Audrey Tang from Taiwan. Audrey is the first Digital Minister of Taiwan, also the first transgender member of the Taiwanese cabinet. Audrey is also an artist and hacktivist and also an anarchist.

                        Given that we’re still in Pride Month, I’d like to start the conversation today about gender identity and in particular ask both of you about your process of self-discovery in your own gender identities and how that has influenced your view of technology. Yuval, we’ll start with you.

                        The process of realizing that I’m gay and coming out really shaped my attitude not just towards technology, but towards science and history in general. It first made me realize how little people can know about themselves. I came out, I realized that I was gay when only when I was 21.

                    <p>
                        I look back at the time when I was 15, I was 16, and I just really can’t understand it. It should have been extremely obvious that I’m attracted to boys and not to girls. I think I’m an intelligent person. I should have figured it out, but I just didn’t. It was kind of a split in my mind, that I didn’t know this about myself.

                        This is why, today, when I look at the development of new surveillance technology, one of the things that most interests me is what happens when somebody out there can know me better than I know myself. I’m quite sure that if Facebook or TikTok or whatever existed when I was a teenager, they could find out I was gay in like two seconds, long, long before I knew that about myself.

                        What does it mean to live in a world when a corporation or a government can know something so important about me that I don’t know about myself? This is one of the big questions I have today about technology and its impact on politics and society.

                        Audrey, can you tell us about your process?

                    <p>
                        Certainly. I will first acknowledge that Taiwan is one of very few, maybe the only jurisdiction now in the world to hold a physical parade, a couple of days ago and yesterday too, of the gay pride and transgender and LGBTIQ rights march.

                    <p>
                        In Taiwan, it’s only been one year since we legalized marriage equality, the first in Asia, by adopting very innovative way of legalizing the by-laws but not the in-laws, meaning that in the legal code, we make sure that when two same-sex couples wed, they wed as individuals with all the same rights and duties.

                        Their families, because in Mandarin we have eight different names for aunts and uncles, these are not affected. This, to me, signifies something that I feel very personally when I was a teenager.

                        My natural testosterone level is that of maybe a 80-year-old male human being, meaning that I’m somewhere between the average male adolescent’s and average female adolescent’s testosterone level when I was 13 or 14 years old.

                        I was very lucky at the time to have discovered the World Wide Web, the Internet, and a lot of gender non-binary and gender queer people who informs me that even though I may be alone in my neighborhood of, say, 100 people…
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Actually even if this is just 1 in 100, 1 in 1000, that means that there’s millions of us [laughs] on the Internet that can form such a non-binary support group to make sure that our own lived-in experiences can be shared freely.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Later on, when I was 24 years old, I would go through the second puberty, the female puberty, which last for another two or three years. It enables me, as someone who works as a poetician, [laughs] making sure that I understand, empathize, with all the different sides.

                    <p>
                        Because in my mind there is no half of the world that’s different from me, I can empathize with other people’s lived experiences because I’ve been through the puberty as well.

                    <p>
                        When we legalized marriage equality, I think it really is an innovation when discovered this intergenerational way of reconciling our different positions – the older generations relying on family and more group values, community values and the younger generation’s more individualistic values.

                    <p>
                        But in our legal code, we make sure that we respect those traditions in a transcultural way. I often translate the official name of our country as The Transcultural Republic of Citizens, and that also constitutes my main work.

                    <p>
                        Great, thank you. Audrey, do you worry about the situation which Yuval describes where technology can know ourselves better than we know ourselves and before we know ourselves?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        A lot of my work is to ensure that social sectors, in RadicalxChange terms, a data coalition or data cooperative owns the means of production – in this case, the production of data.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is to say if people produce data in a way that is passive, that enables a surveillance state or surveillance capitalism, that will lead to the scenario where Yuval was very much articulated in his worries.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        But if the social sector, that is to say, if ordinary citizens can understand that they’re collecting, for example, in Taiwan, the leading contact tracing technology, the winner of our coronavirus Hackathon, Logboard, they collect the whereabouts, their temperatures, their symptoms and so on, but it never transmits anywhere. It keeps it strictly within their phone and not anywhere else.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When the contact tracers, the medical officers come to investigate, it generates a one-time link that has exactly the kind of information that contact tracing needs without divulging any private details about their friends and families, as would often be revealed by a traditional contact tracing interview.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This is just a very simple example, but it shows the autonomous nature of people when they’re owning their own data, when they’re sharing it only with their most intimate and trusted friends and families.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Together, this intersectional data collaborative can prove to be much more powerful than any forced, “Please install this application technology,” that a state or multinational companies can affect on the society.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        So, I would argue that Taiwan’s successful counter-pandemic is based on this kind of social sector collaborative that owns the data and does not store it in the “cloud,” but rather only in each other’s personal devices.

                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        Maybe if I can say something about that. I definitely don’t believe in technological determinism. I don’t think that the kind of either surveillance capitalism or the surveillance totalitarianism that we see developing in some countries – whether it’s in the US or in China – is an inevitable outcome of the current technological breakthrough. I think it’s a big danger.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        The biggest danger really is the rise of a new kind of totalitarianism that we have never seen before in history simply because it’s now technically feasible to follow everybody all the time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        Even in the darkest moments of the 20th century – in Stalin’s Russia or in Mao’s China – it was simply technically impossible to follow everybody all the time and to know them better than you know yourself.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        If you need the police or government agent, KGB agent to follow everybody 24 hours a day, you don’t have enough agents. Even if you have all the agents, they just produce paper reports about what you do. Somebody needs to read the reports and analyze them. That’s impossible.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        Now it’s becoming feasible, technically, to do that because you don’t need human agents, you have all the sensors and cameras and microphones. You don’t need human analysts, you have AI machine learning and so forth. So, it is becoming a possibility, but it’s not inevitable. I think if we take the right actions – like what’s being done in Taiwan – that can prevent this dystopian scenario from happening.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        We saw it in the 20th century that you can use the same technology to build completely different kinds of regimes. You just need to look at South Korea and North Korea. Same people, same geography, same history, same culture using the same technology in a completely different way.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        But an even deeper question is, let’s say we succeed in preventing the rise of digital dictatorship, when some government follows us all the time and knows everything about us, what happens if the data is really collected in a responsible and secure way? It serves us and not the government or some big corporation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Still, the deep, philosophical question is even in this situation, authority is likely to shift away from humans to algorithms in the most important decisions of our lives, like where to study or where to work or whom to marry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s not that I have this online government that forces me to do something. It’s just that I know the algorithm knows me far better than I know myself and can make recommendations for me, and I increasingly just rely on what the algorithm tells me.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        It improves all the time. The algorithm doesn’t need to be perfect. It just needs to be better on average than the mean in making these decisions and gradually the authority will shift.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yuval Noah Harari">
                    <p>
                        Philosophically, I think this is the really big question of our time. Even if we prevent the dystopian scenario of digital dictatorships, how do we deal with democratic algorithms that serve us, but still know us better than we know ourselves?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So maybe we’ll ignore the outline and I will comment on that viewpoint. For the sake of brevity, I’m just going to say “code.” When I say “code,” please think algorithm. Code is having of course the kind of impact as you all describe it.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Code is like law, but it’s not a law of text. It’s like a law of physics in cyberspace because code determines what can happen, what cannot happen. Technically, not cannot happen, but it takes a lot of effort – like being a professional hacker to make it happen. For most people, it’s just it cannot happen because it’s pre-regulated by the code.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        So, it also regulates what is transparent. For example, code can make the state transparent to the citizen, as Taiwan does, or, it can make citizens transparent to the state, as the PRC does and things like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Every time that we deploy code as part of our society, it establishes a normativity. That is, it tells us what’s legal, what’s even thinkable by these lines, just like physics. You cannot even think of, “Oh, I’m going to violate a physics law today,” because that’s just not how the world works.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That basically has a very different position than our current, text-based, normativity. When you can do civil disobedience, you willfully occupy the Parliament, as we did in 2014. Then you argue it’s legal and you convince the judges.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        So, the impact, as Yuval said, is that whenever we deploy code, we must have the same kind of access to justice, to the same kind of access to the open futures, to the different interpretations that’s either agreed to by the social norm, which would be a positive impact, or it will be set a few people and basically restrict everybody else’s imagination, which would have a negative social impact, even if it is not by one or two actors.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

A lot of people today still don’t get the enormous power of coders to actually shape reality. Yes, coders can’t change E=MC2, we can’t change that. But social reality is increasingly constructed by these codes.

You can discover, “Oh, this person or this system, the codes have a bias.” You can explain to people. People can even agree. That will not be enough to change the bias because the bias comes from some place far deeper than our conscious intelligence. It comes from our subconscious.

                        Looking to the future, again, the threat of a rising dictatorship, a new kind of dictatorship is a big one. But even if we avoid that, how to deal with the new tools for hacking the human brain, the human mind, that’s the really big question.

I walk down the beach, and the algorithm analyzes if I focus on cute guys or cute girls. Or, it analyzes what happens to my eyes when I watch videos or television or whatever, and it discovers that I like boys more than girls, and it tells it to or it uses it to manipulate me in some way.

Even though those interpretations may be valid, they also, to a growing teenager, forecloses certain other possibilities because that’s the power of interpretation.

                        To me, I think a way to free ourselves from this value alignment issue is just to have, as a norm, multiple interpretations. Just as you can have many human assistants, each perfectly aligned to you to make accountable explanation if they do some decision not in your best interest, you will have those different human assistants, compare notes. If one of them consistently makes things that are not value-aligned to you, at least you have other assistants to warn you about it.

When we think about user experience, I know some other industries that also use that term user. You only care about the time that you spent addicted with that technology when you use the term user. It’s a zero-sum gain of attention and time span.

                        But people don’t realize that in the long run when you talk about algorithms really taking over – not in a science fiction way of the robots rebelling and trying to kill us – it’s algorithms gathering more and more power to themselves. Even if you have a human president or a human prime minister, actually all the important decisions are being taken by an algorithm that the prime minister cannot even understand.

But I can’t explain to you why because your brain just can’t analyze all the data that I have gathered.” So even though the PM is still the official, the one in charge, actually it’s the algorithm running the show.

                        What this means is that, if you live in a place with some air pollution, and you want to know whether it’s from mobile, a mobile or overseas sources, you reach not for the 100 or so very high-precision weather stations in the country, rather to your primary schools and interesting observations by even high schoolers in their data stewardship classes, using those very cheap, less than 100 US dollars airboxes and connected to the 4G network, which is 16 US dollars per month for unlimited data connection everywhere in Taiwan, because we have broadband as a human right.

The most important thing is not to fall into the trap of thinking that there is a contradiction between nationalism and globalism, and that we need to choose.

                        There is no contradiction. Nationalism is about loving your compatriots, not about taking foreigners. In many situations, like in this pandemic, or with global climate change, if you really love your compatriots, and you want to take care of them, you have to cooperate with foreigners.
