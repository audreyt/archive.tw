                    <p>
                        How was Taiwan’s political civic engagement prior to your government and what did you see as some of the major gaps that needed to be fixed?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When we occupied the Parliament in 2014, when a Cross-Strait Service and Trade Agreement, or the CSSTA, is being rushed through the Parliament, it’s largely seen as a gesture by the parliamentarians that due processes, radical transparency are not very much on their minds, and was evidenced by a 2012 advertisement – I think one of the first YouTube advertisements filmed by the government back then – called the Economic Booster Plan.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The advertisement is very simply structured. It simply showed the citizens of all traits looking very confused as a lot of words whooshing past them – that’s the Economic Booster Plan – and they look like they have no understanding of that at all. Then a background voice says, “Oh, the Booster Plan. Don’t worry about it. You don’t have to understand it. We just have to do it.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think that advertisement was flagged as spam very quickly, because citizens took at this insult.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is also why the g0v movement has been born, directly because of that advertisement, because a bunch of civic hackers, some of them my friends, thought that maybe the problem is not the citizens. Maybe it’s because the state have not made available the budgets in a way that is visualized and are easy to understand. So they did exactly that, forking the government, so to speak.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I would say transparency, accountability, participation, and inclusion were the four things that was largely seen as missing out of negligence when we occupied the Parliament in 2014.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Christopher Balkaran">
                    <p>
                        As you are speaking, it’s like that one critical moment, the straw that broke the camel’s back kind of thing. I could imagine leading up to this point, there was this opaqueness that many in Taiwan felt that government was undertaking public policy direction, and there’s no real understanding as to why the direction was being taken in the way it was, and people felt a disconnect.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Christopher Balkaran">
                    <p>
                        Can you explain a little bit more about that disconnect? It must have happened over many years where people were like, “You know what, I’m totally checked out with this government completely.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sure, certainly. I think this is not out of specifically negligence or anything. It’s more like under the tradition of Freedom of Information Act or FOIA, the government only publishes after a decision is made. That is to say, as usual actually with FOIA acts, the government doesn’t have to publish anything in the drafting stage when the governments still have no idea what’s going on, but it is precisely those drafting stage documents, conversation records, and meeting minutes.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        These are the most valuable, because it explains the context, the why of policymaking, not just the what of policies made. Even though there is a clause in our FIA law that says, “Oh, but if it’s of public benefit, as approved by the superiors, then the public servants can publish things in the drafting stage.” Very few public servants actually use that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When I become Digital Minister around four years ago, I said, “OK, any meeting that I chair, any meeting with journalists or lobbyists, the entirety of the transcript or the video recording need to be published. It’s always of public benefit.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s my working condition. Then people saw that this radical transparency, meaning transparency at the root, really helped inviting people of various different ideas in the society to co-create much more effectively, because they can now understand why we’re doing this or why we’re not doing this.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Christopher Balkaran">
                    <p>
                        What you’re doing in recording all your conversations reminds me very closely of what Mr. Hansard did in, I think it was, Great Britain. I’m not sure if you know about the Hansard system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Basically, it was the House of Commons had all these representatives from various parties. They would debate, and nobody took verbatim notes as to what questions were being asked, what was the response from the government, or other members of opposition.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Christopher Balkaran">
                    <p>
                        Literally, somebody sitting in the stands sat down and just took these notes of everything that was being said exactly as you just mentioned for radical transparency and for more civic participation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Christopher Balkaran">
                    <p>
                        I guess coming out of that, my question would be what have been some of the early results in terms of, I’m sure you can probably sense who’s watching or how many people are downloading some of the meetings that you’re having.

                    <p>
                        Certainly. I started work 2016 October as Digital Minister. Almost immediately, I think in November, there is just this interesting case that came my way. In October, when I first become Digital Minister, the Parliament held a public hearing about e-sport, which is very interesting in Taiwan, because it’s in this no-ministries land.

                        The Ministry of Culture says it’s not part of our traditional culture. Maybe come back when e-sport have 100 years of history.

                        There’s really no ministries taking care of that particular issue of specifically the rights of the e-sport athletes. Of course, the athletes voiced their concerns, and we made sure that we captured everything they said about military service, about the lack of possibility of getting a large venue.

                        These are very real suffering and pain points that no ministries was considering themselves equipped to handle. After collecting all these thought and pain points in October, in November, we started this internal cross-ministerial conversation.

                        We published the transcript. People who are posting the most upvoted ideas really came up with really, really good arguments. For example, they said that Weiqi – Go as in AlphaGo, I guess – is now an e-sport, because most people compete online, and AI plays better than human beings, which are the two e-sport qualifications.

                        There’s people who argue, for example, it’s a sport, but it’s not a physical sport. It’s an intellectual sport. There are some clauses in the Ministry of Education’s regulations that you can look at and so on.

                        Before I get to that, I wanted to chat. I think the reason why we need, or Taiwan needs, a Digital Minister like yourself is because the rate of technology and the rate of its increasing, increases over the past 5 to 10 years, has been so exponential that it is a full-time job just to keep up.

                        I think the millennial generation is very equipped, but I even see my friends falling back a little bit with technology. There sometimes is, and I hate to be this kind of generational gap, but had there been an older minister in charge of the digital ministry, there’s so much there to unpack and uncover.

                        Anyway, I digress. The point here, I think, is that we’ve always been looking at this reverse mentorship tradition in the Taiwanese political system. Starting from 1990, when the White Lily – it’s also an occupy movement back then – demanding for direct presidential election.

                        There’s this honored tradition – not very long, 30 years long – of the younger people pointing out the direction and the older generations providing the resources and the know-how to realize that new direction for the country.

                        As a reverse mentor, the system is such that people under 35 years old can work with ministers on day-to-day basis, shadow the minister’s work, and pointing out – because younger people don’t take things for granted, pointing out – what innovative, out-of-the-box directions there might be. For example, using AI to listen at scale to solve Uber. That was that.

                        The point here is that each ministry related to social innovation – that’s 12 ministries – each would appoint two such reverse mentors. Some of them, like in their 20s, have already suggested, for example, our most skilled champions of the World Skills Competition.

                        Just one quick example that I alluded to in my TED Talk. There was a time back in I think it was early April, when we started rationing out the masks, because our mask production at the time is not even 2 million a day, and we have 23 million people.
                    </p>

                        That’s a shortage. That’s a shortage. Then, of course, we eventually ramped it up so that we produce more than 20 million medical masks a day, ensuring plenty of supply to all people. That will take us a couple months to do that.

                    <p>
                        During those two months, rationing is inevitable. I initially thought, “OK, maybe it’s an easy thing in convenience stores,” which we were already shipping the stockpiled masks to. There are ways to pay through mobile payment. There are ways to pay through credit card, and there’s this thing called the EasyCard, and so on, which you can register your name.

                    <p>
                        That’s jargon for saying that we do not know specifically the identity of people. We just know that people could not double-stand outside of their quota if we link up the payment systems together.

                    <p>
                        I thought this was such a good idea. Then the people on the street, there’s a person, Howard Wu in Tainan, literally coded up a map for his friends and family to register where in the convenience store or pharmacies still have masks in stock and still not replenished, so you should go somewhere else to queue and so on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s immediately obvious to everybody, not just me, that uses Howard Wu’s map that, without a participatory accountability, nobody will actually trust the numbers of the rationing.

                        People would immediately doubt that somehow people with multiple phones, multiple credit cards, and things like that would somehow get more masks than they’re allotted. There really is no way for us in the government to prove that. Not to mention that there are people without any name-based payment systems, and what about those people? These are maybe 30 percent of the population. Do they have no masks at all?

                        Right. They prefer cash, and we should actually allow cash-based deployment, because otherwise there is no point reducing the r-value if only slightly over half of population is masked. My idea was a terrible idea.

                        The civic engagement, especially at the local level, you can’t debate the numbers, and you can’t debate the need. If you get to the will of the people, which it sounds like Taiwan is getting to much more closely than many countries, and you get to the need, then what’s the debate?

                        That’s exactly right. I guess the debate could also be on incentive design. How do you convince people who do not have a habit of wearing mask to wear a mask? Eventually, the rough consensus on that in Taiwan is this message, very simple. “You wear a mask to protect yourself from your own unwashed hands.” This is really good as a meme, because it travels, appeals to self-interest as a social signal to remind other people to use soap to wash their hands, because without which, the mask doesn’t work, anyway, and so on.

                        The result should always be a rough consensus that allows for more input along the way. Then when there is a really good input, we then just amplify it 24 hours in a rapid, like daily, live streamed Central Epidemic Command Center press conference, such as the boy saying that he doesn’t want to go to school, because he would be bullied.

                        Just like preordering the mask, you just insert the card into the kiosk. You say, “I want to file my income tax,” and then you click OK on the screen. That calculates for you, and then you go to the counter of the convenience store, and you pay your tax. It’s that simple.

                        The great thing about working with the social sector is that, just like queuing in the pharmacy, relying on people queuing before and after you to keep the system honest, if we design a system with the social sector supervision, and with the criteria co-created with the social sector, then everybody understands what’s running on their own general-purpose devices.

This is what we want to leave off,” and so on.

I’m going to do my best to do civic engagement for the people to tell me what the best way forward is. Far be it from me to dictate what our platform is.” I could also see people saying, “Well, I need to what I’m voting for before I vote for it.”

                        First, you explore. That is to say, you ask people how do they feel – if they feel painful or if they suffering, or if they feel elation, they feel joy. There really is no right or wrong. You don’t have to converge on a single feeling.

                        Can another government come along and say, “You know what, the previous government did some great stuff with digital social innovation. We’re going to continue it.”

                        The political process is what it is, and a lot of politicians don’t want to be connected sometimes with previous governments and things like that. How is Taiwan ensuring that this process stays apolitical, non-partisan, and can withstand changes in government?

                        Fortunately, after occupying the Parliament, all the mayors, regardless of parties, who supported open government gets elected, sometimes without preparing inauguration speech, and all who do not did not get elected.

                        In our parliament at this point, of the four major parties, this is literally one of the only things that they all agree. They all signed on the Open Government Partnership, Open Parliament Declaration, and building their own multi-stakeholder forums. This is definitely a norm in Taiwan.

                        I personally work with five premiers in two presidents, the two presidents belonging to different parties, of course. All of them are saying open governments, collective intelligence. That’s just Taiwan’s future.

                        I think this is partly prompted by the fact that they’re saying anything that’s inborn is human nature – that is to say, that’s around when I’m born – and anything that’s not around when I’m born is technology.

                        For Taiwan, democracy itself is technology. I was born when martial law was still in effect. When we first had a presidential election in 1996, this is already after the World Wide Web. We are in a rare position in which we see even our constitution as something like a technology, like kernel design or mechanism design, that we can experiment, and iterate, and make better.

                    <p>
                        When you have a polity like that, where constitution is in itself a technology, I think people take a much more open attitude toward collective intelligence.

                        I would say that instead of replicating the Taiwan model, I would encourage people, as you alluded to earlier, to start small, to look at a small community, a county or something, and try out those listening skills, the facilitative methods, and deliberative methods.

                        People will feel much more empowered, because they would say, “Oh, every part of our life, actually, can be made better by this sort of deliberative and facilitative processes.”

                        It’s incredible. I’m still trying to rub my head around the fact that politicians, mayors would actually sign on to this, because again, [laughs] I grew up in Toronto. Just the partisan nature of politics over here is very much “You have your issues and you fight for them.”

                        It’s very, many times, black and white. In Taiwan, what I’m seeing is that people are OK saying that, “Hey, I have my opinions, but if it’s not aligning with what ideas are of the general population that I oversee as mayor, I’m OK with following that direction.” That is the most important point we’re taking.

                        …or like the Italian comedians. In Taiwan, the only political party that I publicly supported was the very happy party, or literally, their English name is “Can’t Stop This Party.” They’re all professional comedians and YouTubers, like truly professionals, so humor over rumor.

                        That’s really important. If you participate in politics with fast, fair, and fun, and emphasize the fun part, optimized for fun, that’s going to change the nature that you just described of polarization, which is all very serious and sometimes toxic.
