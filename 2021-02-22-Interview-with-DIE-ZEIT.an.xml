                        Thank you so much for making time. I have a question. I just got here on public transport. I took a bus, which is an incredible feeling. The life outside seems fairly normal, except that people are wearing masks like me.

                    <p>
                        I’m interested in whether you think that…Is Taiwan living with COVID, or are people in Taiwan living with COVID, or is Taiwan already in the post pandemic period?

                    <p>
                        For a while. It felt like post pandemic when we had this Pride Parade, and when there’s more than three, four months with no local cases at all. That felt post pandemic.

                    <p>
                        Recently, the Taoyuan hospital had everybody on guard again, and you see people wearing masks again. It lasted for a few weeks, almost a month, but now we’re down to zero level cases again. It doesn’t feel quite post pandemic just yet, but I predict [laughs] two months from now, if it continues to be no local cases, we’ll again feel post-pandemic.

                    <p>
                        You think, for Taiwanese people to feel like their post pandemic, it needs to be several months…

                    <p>
                        OK, yeah. I think that seems to make sense. Do you think it is possible to live with the virus circulating in the country, or does it have to be eradicated?

                    <p>
                        That’s you. OK. Eventually, it needs to be eradicated, because if you don’t, it mutates. If it mutates, it gets more deadly. As long as there’s anywhere in the world a large population suffering from the virus, it means that it will just keep mutating to be more and more difficult to contain or to prevent.

                    <p>
                        Yes, just one question. I cut in because this question is very important for our German readers, because German politicians say, “If you plan to eradicate the virus, you have to deal with it. You have to live with the virus. It’s impossible to get the numbers down to zero.” What do you think of that?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even with the vaccines?

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even with the vaccines, like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Marc Brost">
                    <p>
                        No, not the vaccines, not the next step in strategy. During the last year, we had this discussion in Germany. When we didn’t have the vaccines, we had a discussion in Germany, “Should we eradicate the virus, like Taiwan did, or other countries did?” or “Have we to deal with a rate of 50 or 35 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants?” What do you think of…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even before we have biological vaccines, we already have this sort of physical vaccines, right? Especially, medical grade masks has been proven to be really, really useful even if some part of the virus, especially mutations, are being more airborne transmitted than previously thought.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Still, a medical grade mask protects you in many of these scenarios as well. It protects people from their own hands, their own unwashed hands. If people practiced mask wearing as much as Taiwan people did, then arguably, that’s already a physical vaccine. That’s already “herd immunity.” That’s already ways to cut down the R value to be under 1, even if there’s no biological vaccines yet.

                    <p>
                        Taiwan rests on this premise that it is possible to eliminate the virus using purely public health measures, and border control, and quarantine, and things like that. That’s the hypothesis we’re running with.

                        That’s a nice segue into the next big topic that we want to talk about. Can you briefly describe how and when Taiwan started reacting to COVID? How the Taiwanese government, or Taiwan as an entire country, reacted, and why it reacted so early?

                        2004 is important because that’s the year that our universal healthcare, the National Healthcare Service went to IC cards. It became entirely digitized. In 2003, when SARS hit Taiwan early, the very small island of Penghu, the Pescadores island, had IC card. Everybody else in the main Taiwan island was still using those paper cards with stamps on it.

                    <p>
                        What a difference it makes. If you compare the SARS 1.0, as I refer to it, in the Taiwan main island and in the Penghu island, you can see how much a IC card in the national universal healthcare changes people’s behavior. People do not need to feel concerned that they will suffer financial or social damage by going to a clinic to check their symptoms.

                        There’s less of a problem of people working with the medical offices, because they know that they will get all covered, even if it’s not COVID. It’s universal healthcare, you’re going to be covered one way or another anyway. The upshot is that in Taiwan, it’s cheaper to get this full diagnosis on a local clinic. That’s in addition to go to a local pharmacy to get a mask.

                        It’s both quicker and cheaper than the drive-through PCR tests in some other countries. That influenced Taiwanese behavior to be more pro social, because we won’t hide our symptoms. A lot of it is already there in 2004.

                        In 2004 also, the constitutional court work with the legislature to pass the Communicable Diseases Act, which institutionalized the collective memory of the chaotic communication in 2003 where the municipal and the central government was saying very different things.

                        We codified that institutional memory into the CDA, so that the act says that from this point onward, the Central Epidemic Command Center, or the CECC, is going to take over the entire communication duty, so that each ministry need to work with the CECC send secondments, delegates to the CECC.

                        It’s because, in December 31st, Dr. Li Wengliang’s message about the “seven SARS cases in the Huanan seafood market” made its round into PTT. That’s the Taiwanese group on Reddit. A very young doctor, Nomorepipe is her nickname, reposted it. People triaged the legitimacy [laughs] of the documents presented by Dr. Li Wengliang.

In particular, some people in Europe are under the impression that the reason Taiwan was able to largely eradicate COVID is because Taiwan went through a strict lockdown, and closed everything at some point.

                        That’s not what we mean by lockdown. What we meant by lockdown, like in 2003, we had to barricade the Hoping Hospital. It means that people there cannot go to the street to buy food. We’ve never gone through anything like that in Taiwan this time around. Partly, because anyone over 30 years old remember how bad the Hoping barricade was.

                        We didn’t want to repeat that, because there’s a lot of trauma associated. If you bring up the word SARS and Hoping Hospital, people who are above 30 years old is going to think about something unpleasant, their personal memory from it. Because of that, we focus on the border quarantine pretty much on day one of the CECC’s setting up.

                        Though quarantine regime may feel very strict, but it’s also applied with equity. That is to say, we pay people a stipends, like 30 euros per day, for working with the quarantine for 14 days. They can choose to quarantine at a hotel, or even at their own residence if they live by their own residence. They don’t have to go to the central quarantine places.

                        In Taiwan, we strengthened democracy during the pandemic and the infodemic, precisely because we invited citizens to contribute novel ways. From the very everyday thing, like using traditional rice cookers to cook the masks so it kills the virus and not the mask.

                        To the more high tech, like visualization of mask distribution points, and mask distribution strategies from the civic technologies, the mask map. There’s endless innovations from the social sector that form very tight people to people relationships, with, say, the mask map running in South Korea a month after we started in February, or working on the Dashboard to counter COVID in the Tokyo Metropolis with the people in Kofu, Japan, and so on.

                        The beauty of democracy is that people have the freedom to try new things and to innovate. To scale out those social innovations. It’s a great time for democracy to deepen, among the population, if we don’t resort only for the pandemic lockdown, or for the infodemic takedown measures, because that would restrict the space for the civil society to contribute.

                        One criticism that we hear in Germany a lot is that Germany cannot possibly learn from Taiwan because Taiwan was only able to beat the virus because it is an island. Germany, as a country in the middle of the Schengen Area, in the middle of the European Union, could not adopt a similar approach. I’m curious what your view is on that.

                        Us being island does have its advantage in that the quarantine measures are easier to implement. On the other hand, we have one of the highest population densities around, which make any slip in the counter pandemic public health measures almost very difficult to, I would say almost impossible to recover.

                        If we didn’t do the eradication strategy well, for us to do the coping strategy would be very, very difficult because of the sheer population density. We have something going for, something going against, but I don’t think that it’s categorically islands have it easier.

                        Yeah, definitely. That’s why we call it the Taiwan Model. The Taiwan Model, its first and foremost this trust from the government to its citizens. We do not, for example, institute a very top down emergency state when there’s issues like the community spread on nightlife district.

                        It’s first and foremost why I call it people public private partnership where the people understand the epidemiological ideas behind those measures and can always suggest better measures to the CECC. It’s not a top down model. It’s especially attractive to democracies, especially in liberal democracies. It also has wide applicability even in the more authoritarian parts of the world.

                        You mentioned earlier how important it is that now there’s only one source of information, the CECC. Isn’t there a bit of a contradiction there with this idea that there’s a bottom up process? On the one hand, you’re talking about this bottom up process. On the other hand, you’re talking about the centralization of authoritative information. That seems a bit contradictory.

                    <p>
                        The “authoritative information” corrects itself publicly all the time by the inputs of people calling into the toll free number, of the daily press conference, which they run for more than 100 days, I think, non stop. The journalists are free to ask every question. The press conference doesn’t end until the journalists had their satisfaction.

                        Journalism is at least equally important to the command in the CECC. The journalists, the Minister Chen Shih chung refer to them as fellow partners, and doing great detective work, innovation work. He even offered to teach epidemiology to all the journalists.

                        This is very important because the journalist knows about emerging developments better than the career public service in many cases. When a journalist raised those points to the CECC, Mr. Chen never said that this is ridiculous. He never defends executive policy. He always says, “Teach us,” or, “Let’s work together,” and things like that.

                        The twin characteristics of absolute journalistic freedom and input, and a very accountable daily iteration cycle. If the CECC gets something wrong, it apologizes very quickly in public, 24 hour at most after the fact. That builds trustworthiness to all the parties involved. It’s not your traditional authoritarian way of keeping the information only to the CECC folks and leaving everybody in the dark.

                        Yeah, a lot. For example, in the beginning of the mask rationing, we thought this is a great idea for the civil society to come up with the visualization map so that people queuing in line can see that people queuing before them swiped their national health card and get 2 at a time — now 10 at a time — and check it for themselves. It’s participatory accountability. Great idea.

                    <p>
                        But on the day of the launch, February 6th, some pharmacists invented their own social innovation, which we call take a number system, so that people take their card to the pharmacy. Instead of taking the mask, they just leave their card there, their ID card, and get a number card. This piece of number, they can go back in the evening to collect the IC card and the mask.

                        This take a number system absolutely destroys the mask availability map. If you look at the pharmacies’ record, because they process all the IC cards during lunch break, it’ll look like there’s still nothing in the morning. Sells everything during lunch break. It’s, frankly speaking, not very useful.

                        It’ a clash. It’s like Coca Cola and Mentos, independently good things. [laughs] We apologized very quickly. We didn’t say that the pharmacies have to swipe the IC card during the queuing. You can’t collect IC cards, which is what the authoritarian CECC would do. Instead, we said, “We’re sorry. We didn’t know that this will run like this. We will consult the pharmacists of what to do.”

During 8:00 to 9:00, there’s still a one hour window where we’re available on the map, the app, but we’re actually not available. We’ve already run out of the cards for the day for our daily ration.”

A day afterwards, then the banner is gone. We didn’t change anything, so what happened? I step in and they said, “Hey, we figured out this hack.”

                        If you have 15 percent of people breaking their quarantine with no consequence, then that number will grow into 30, 40, 50 until such a day where quarantine doesn’t mean much anymore. There is no way, island or not, to defend against a respiratory disease if you don’t have a working quarantine system.

                        I have one follow up on this to where…This is the one thing I’ve been trying to look into, in that it has been quite difficult, because there hasn’t been that much information about it. There’s some reports of some digital surveillance being used retrospectively as part of contact tracing. This is also common assumption in Germany that this happens regularly.

                        My understanding that this means that the local health offices sometimes work with the police, and ask police to access sometimes phone data, sometimes credit card data, and sometimes surveillance cameras. I’m curious because that’s different from…

                        Do you have a sense of…? I’m not sure how close you work with the CECC, but I’m specifically curious whether you know whether any digital surveillance was used as part of contact tracing the Taiyuan outbreak recently. The CECC had to find contacts of the people who are infected very quickly.

                        Yeah, it seems contained now. Far as I understand, they use traditional content tracing interviews. Personal reports of the interviewees are correlated with whatever. The CECC sent us data. That includes, for example, CCTV data and other data as well. CECC contains secondments, delegates from all the various ministries.

                        The minister of interior, the Police Department will have access to CCTV data for specific use for contact tracing and so on. As far as I understand, it’s not a case of following the telephone surveillance stuff. This is more like if there are gaps in travel histories reported by the contact tracing interview.

                        Then full informing the person being content traced, they could go into the kind of report that you just mentioned to remind that particular person of their travel history. It’s hard to remember exactly which places you’ve been to in the past 14 days. I don’t know specifically whether it’s applied to the Taiyuan Hospital case. I’m just talking in a more general fashion.

                        Right. That makes sense. Actually, in that sense also, if there is some uncertainty around this. You’re a digital minister, but you’re also a minister without portfolio. This question in particular also touches on data protection which, as far as I understand, there’s not much of a legal basis.

                    <p>
                        There is a legal basis. It’s GDPR compatible, except there’s no central independent data protection authority under the current Taiwanese data protection laws, which is almost a carbon copy of the pre GDPR European law. We use a European system.

                    <p>
                        The main difference is just that each ministry is its own competent authority to all the businesses that has that ministry as the overseeing agency. We don’t have a single DPA. We have 12, or 15, or 16 — I lost count — DPAs. If you’re a business and you register with the Ministry of Economy, then the MOEA is going to be your PPA and so on.

                    <p>
                        Because of that, you can’t get almost the same GDPR-like experience if you file a request. One, the DPAs are going to answer you, but there’s two hurdles. First, there really is no very clear map about, say, in the digital fence system exactly how many ministries are in place. You’ll probably have to do this discovery inquiry process with as much as five ministries.

                    <p>
                        That’s a lot of burden. The other thing is that because technically a minister have the final power over whether their DPA find something objectionable or not, it’s true that if a ministry’s public servants do something, it’s less likely that their minister would say that you’re wrong. It’s why GDPR insists on independent DPA. It’s just human nature if you report to a minister, you’re less likely to say that a minister violates privacy.

                        Looking back, and particularly in light of this, it sounds quite complicated for individual citizens to be able to uphold their privacy rights. Do you think in hindsight, the government could’ve done a better job of empowering its citizens to protect the privacy and also demand this privacy to be protected, especially in the time of COVID?

                        It’s one of those languages. That’s the in group may use, not out group. It’s a offense. [laughs] We deal with this intentional misinformation in a way that relies on the civil society to flag incoming messages on their end to end encrypted channels like LINE, which is like WhatsApp and spam.

                        It’s just like if you get an incoming email, you flag it as spam. It’s not just moving it out of your inbox, but you’re also contributing signal to the international spam house. That will help every other recipient of the same spam email to move those into a junk mail folder rather than the inbox.

                        We have a very similar system going on here with the international fact checking network as well as with local partners, like the leading antivirus company in town called Trend Micro. It has its own…I think it’s called Virus Buster that is a LINE bot. If you added a friend and forward misinformation to it, it can get back to you with real time clarification.

                        If you’re invited into your family chattering and anytime people share anything about like 5G towers, then it just pops out a clarification in real time. There’s also another startup called Whoscall that has a very similar offering called 美玉姨. Both of them built upon the same g0v project called Cofacts, which is for collaborative fact checking.
