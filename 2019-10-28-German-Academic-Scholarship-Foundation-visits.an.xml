A lot of the issues that you briefly touched on about how digital is transforming the urban landscape, how self-driving vehicles, telework, or whatever, 5G, is reconfiguring people’s idea of proximity and things like that.

                        In the lab, we’re trying to shape the norm upon which the people want to integrate or want these new creatures to co-domesticate with us, and, together, find out the optimal or at least socially acceptable integration path for those self-driving tricycles serving as shopping carts for people.

                        This is what we call a norm-first design or, in UN parlance, a co-governance design. Instead of passing any law, we’re inviting people to do a lot of what we call sandbox experiments and invite all the 12 different ministries in, and for them to settle on a social norm after a year or so of AI-moderated discussion.

                        Then we set a market policy, and then that turns into programming, new code, and finally into law. To do the other way is very top-down and builds a surveillance state or surveillance capitalism very quickly. What we’re trying to do is to empower the social sector to take governance and control of that mechanism.

I sit along Glen Weyl the economist or Vitalik Buterin the Etherium inventor, and so on, using blockchain ideas and mechanism design to empower the social sector so that the social innovation can happen without over-reliance or industrial innovation. That’s my main mandate.

                        Interesting story, my dad was a journalist as I said, but he covered the Tiananmen Protest up until June the 1st, and went home. Fortunate for our family. Then made it a research focus for him to understand how the social dynamic works in the Tiananmen Protest. He went to Saarland University to study with Professor Jürgen Domes, doing his PhD thesis on particularly that topic.

Most of my father’s research subjects, they were just people around your age were all completing their study abroad because they couldn’t return to the PRC anymore, because they participated in the Tiananmen Protest.

                        In Taiwan, we’re prototyping a kind of democracy that focus on plurality. This is essentially the condition upon which we do diplomacy to all the like-minded countries, Germany included. This plurality-based liberal democracy was once called the end of civilization, but it’s less hip now, thanks partly to the advent of social media in its amplification of the divisiveness. Our main work, still, is to focus on this plurality of democracy.

Something extremely innovative have to be found for that to happen.

                        Taiwan took 10 years to talk about what e-sport should belong, whether it’s a sport, whether it’s a cultural performance, whether it’s educational material. Whether this is something that’s just industrial, whether it is something social, whether it’s addictive, whether it’s bad for the health, whether it’s good for the health, and so on, for 10 years.

                        Before I become digital minister, it was deadlocked. The premiers of the previous cabinets tried various different strategies, but they never did any coherent plan because the three ministries involved all think very differently, have very philosophical takes on the e-sport issue. We begin with a radical transparency idea. Esport.pdis.tw has the nitty-gritty details.

                        The idea, very simply put, is that we started with a public hearing in the month that I joined, in October ‘16, in which case you can see it’s not like most summaries. It’s just a play-by-play entire verbatim transcript of the e-sport competitors outlining their real differences with the traditional sports but also their real needs in comparison with the real sport athletes and so on.

                        I said, “Within two weeks, everything will be public, and so make your argument solid. Maybe edit away the in-jokes and things like that.” It’s just that the argument is because, in Taiwan, sport translates sometimes as PE or physical education. The Ministry of Education thinks that there’s nothing physical in e-sport, so it really shouldn’t be their business. It should be Ministry of Culture.

                        I always credit the wide Internet for proposing these. The ministries at hand saw that as a valid point because that person, senior public servant, was a Wéiqí player. [laughs] He’s actually quite flexible now that we only established that it should be as much as Wéiqí player and not the same as a basketball player, so it’s easy for them to change.

Perhaps the most important shape here is that using AI-based conversation from the wide Internet, we can always show the ministries at hand that most people agree on most of the things most of the time.

                        This kind of radical transparency ensures two things. The first is that the public service gets all the credit. Previously, if they do something right, they don’t get the credit. The minister does. If they do something wrong, the minister can always blame the public service, so it’s a no-win situation for them to innovate.

                        Using this way, you can see exactly who is the Wéiqí-playing Ministry of Culture public servant that came upon this interesting idea from the PTT and did a innovative solution. We invite them to the press conferences. We make sure that we feature their faces in my presentations and so on, so they get the full credit.

                        That’s the social impact of radical transparency. It makes the payoff matrix for the public servant flipped about so that they always get incentivized when they innovate. If it breaks down, we absorb all the risk. That is the first thing.

                        The second case, which is shorter, is because, in each and every ministry, we have a team called participation officers, just like media officer talking to journalists or parliamentary officers talking to the MPs. We just had a meeting with all their supervisors, which are all deputy ministers or general secretary for the ministry. They report a very direct line to the minister.

Two years ago, there was a 16-year-old that we didn’t know was 16-year-old that called for the banning of plastic straws and all the one-use utensils, single-use utensils, because it’s bad for the ocean and bad for carbon cycle.

The EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, thought it must be a senior environmental activist to get this kind of outreach.

You would think that the business side will be against that idea, but it turns out that the people who showed up, who make those single-use plastic utensils, said they joined this business 30 years ago when they were young as social entrepreneurs.

                        These business folks got new materials to work with and activists try to get them critical deals from the suppliers, and after two years of communication, this year we just passed straws for indoor drinking, and we have a lot more upcycling economy thanks to the initial collaboration.

The idea of this design is to make sure that we can turn the energy from activists into social innovation and social entrepreneurship.

                        That’s a – wow, it took 10 minutes – a short answer to the outlook as well as the impact of radical transparency, as well how the public service think it as a way to absorb the risk and let them get credit. The obvious next question is what do other ministries think about it? You can tell by which ministries send people to my office.

                        At the beginning, it’s the usual suspects. The Ministry of Communication and Culture, obviously, and then Interior, Education, Law, Finance, and so on. After a year or so, public service from the Foreign Affairs Committee thought it was a great idea because they’re starting to use the same AI-moderated conversation to set diplomatic agenda.

Again, we see one divisive issue, quote every time China closes the international door for Taiwan, the US should try open one for Taiwan someplace else.

                        For example, sending somebody to the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, and after a couple weeks they send somebody to Taiwan Presidential Hackathon. It’s easy as that, because there are many low-hanging fruits, so to speak. It’s much easier to focus on them than on that particular divisive issue, although that divisive issue sells newspapers.

                        On the basic level all the regulations and most of the bills went through this public commentary and discussion period. On the second level, we also have the collaboration meetings where we choose the ones that are particularly contentional, or particularly difficult, particularly not within any ministry’s purview, by a voting by all the participation officers.

                        In Taiwan we say meeting face to face builds 30 percent of trust, but across the Internet, if it’s broadband, you can build 20 percent of trust. With 5G maybe 25 percent of trust, because you can get micro expression more. The idea is that they don’t have to see each other only as abstract transcripts, they can just do a lot of back and forth.

                        The Minister of Health and Welfare can brainstorm with Minister of Interior instead of saying, “We’ll copy the ministry. The ministry’s just sitting nearby.” Because of that, they can brainstorm on the spot. Again, they get all the credit and much more credibility actually, because they can see them face to face and actually solving the issues right there.

                        Many long-held regulatory deadlocks, for example there was one about whether associations can start and control a for-profit company, essentially make it a social enterprise that answers to the parenting association. That was decided right there, and there’s a lot of regulatory changes around company that want to have a social/environmental purpose as well.

                        Every year the President gives out five award, it’s like a prototype fund, but the one that actually got the five winning spots gets a trophy form our President, the trophy looks something like this, but it’s a projector, there’s no prize money. When turned on, it projects the President handing a trophy to you, so it’s very meta, and each time are cross-sectorial.

                        Each time the trophy gets turned on, their Director General will come up with budget, and their ministry will come to the regulatory and personnel adjustments, so every year we make five such bypasses into the regulatory idea, and that actually enhances the social innovation lab’s presence, because every year we took those five ideas that are then promised by the President to be integrated into the public service within a year.

                        That triggered a conversation in the national security council and the national communication commission, who did a systemic risk analysis and they concluded two points. The first is that in the PRC, because they install party branches in large enterprises and so on, there is no pure market player.

                        Any pure market actor can at any given time become de facto state-owned, if escalation – actually nowadays it doesn’t require escalation if people feel like it – they will become de facto state-controlled. Because of that, we shouldn’t really treat them in the same WTO-based economic order, in the context of core 4G infrastructure.

                        The second thing is the cybersecurity argument. Instead of saying the current generation contains cybersecurity loopholes, we say this creates a past dependence. If you use their 3G software and hardware, it’s actual very difficult to not use them for 4G, not to use them for 5G, and so on.

                        At any given time where there’s a systemic break of a virus or something, you have to trust the vendor to supply you with the kind of hot patch, and these hot patches are deemed too great a risk, because of that they’re claim Taiwan, I guess, to greater risk to allow into the core infrastructure.

                        We made our decision back then, which is why during the 5G discussion you don’t hear much from Taiwan because we had that discussion five years ago. From that point on, built a alternate supply chain, especially for the Taiwan public service, but now extends to the critical infrastructures, including the industrial parks, which includes the Taiwan semiconductors.

                        Each government projects now must allocate five percent to seven percent to cybersecurity, that’s separate from the IT budget, it’s just cybersecurity budget. We invite a lot of penetration tester, white hat hackers, to test the system that I personally brought in also as Digital Minister in open source, and welcoming them to just find holes in it.

                        In that we’re building a cybersecurity industry, but also an entire supply chain based on non-PRC components. This is not saying that we’re not doing business with PRC, we’re just saying that if a friendly jurisdiction want to build their connectivity infrastructure and they said that they don’t want PRC components, we’re ready to deliver it whenever.

                        In all our design spaces, there is no reply button. We found that, with the reply button, people with the most time wins the argument by default because nobody want to squander that much time to play with trolls. Without a reply button, there’s no trolls anymore. People just compete on getting more nuanced, eclectic feeling.

                        My point is that by changing the social media to be convergent instead of divergent, even the lobbyists see that it may be in their best interest to proposed nuanced issues and suggestion that can convince across the aisle. We used this to do UberX and Airbnb. UberX was solved pretty well.

                        Airbnb lobbied all their members in Taiwan to join this platform and expect them to vote for Airbnb. But once you are in this platform, it’s not like a referendum. There’s no yes or no. There’s no support or against. This was just full of people’s feelings that you can resonate or not with.

                    <p>
                        Once people go there and spend three or four weeks, even the Airbnb members who have used Airbnb before, only one-third supported the Airbnb party line. Two-third came up with much better, more nuanced regulation ideas.

                        Let the reflection phase, the feeling phase cook for a longer period is a much better way for people with different positions to eventually come to common understanding. It’s mostly mechanism design.

                        The minorities, they all get their voices. As you can see, this is not corresponding to the people who agreed. This value can be 1,000. It doesn’t matter. If you mobilize 5,000 people to vote exactly the same way, it’s one dot here.

                        It measures that diversity of opinion. It doesn’t measure at all the support. Basically, even if you can mobilize a lot of people here, it doesn’t change the shape of the clusters. You still have to convince the other three groups for your idea to be included in the agenda.

                        For this kind of interface design, which is a social media that we set up ourselves, people are by default exposed to people who don’t think like them, but if they want to go back to the people who feel the same – the stratosphere, as we call it, 同溫層 – here, they can always click the group that represents them, and then they can see what’s going on.

                    <p>
                        Let’s take a real example. For example, currently there’s many debates going on. The current one is about promoting US-Taiwan security cooperation. There’s people feeling differently. You can go to each one and see how they differ, but also how they agree.

                        This, it servers two purposes. First is that you can see your friends and families on the other side of the aisle, but they’re not sure. They’re not nameless enemies. They’re still your friends and family, it’s just you didn’t talk about this over at dinner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second thing is that there are people who support your opinion, as well. This clustering both makes it more polity forming, because as time goes by it was actually four different small groups. They’re converged to the middle so that people arrive to common understanding by looking into that picture.

                    <p>
                        Also, the other thing is that during this digital dialog – just a second. If you google digital dialog, that’s the first hit. It’s pretty good SEO – you can also see that only people who convince people on the other side gets the voice, gets the response from the administration.

                        You don’t ever get one from this one, which is the most contention, most divisive one out of the commerce conversation, which is when Taiwanese companies do corporate social responsibility in other countries, then we should also still give them tax breaks because those are diplomatic. It’s very divisive [laughs] , but there are many things that people probably agree on.

                        People can see this by themselves They don’t have to trust a minister’s words, because if you sort by grouped informed consensus you can see exactly how much consensus each one has across different groups. If you’re a data geek you can also do a lot more analysis based on this. There was a virtual reality view on this. It’s very interesting.

                        In any case, what I’m saying is that this shows people that we are a polity, after all, among the divisiveness. That that’s the main point.

                    <p>
                        Yes, of course. That’s very much a worthy-to-discuss topic. We had slices of those discussed using the platform. There was a petition that want to change Taiwan’s time zone to +9 to agree with Japan and Korea.

                        There was 8,000 people here, but also 8,000 people that petitioned for Taiwan to remain in GMT+8. Both sides have a lot of support arguments. [laughs] We responded. It’s written up. I can send you the URL later.

                    <p>
                        The idea is that we mind mapped all their arguments and make sure that we’re on the same page as re. data. For example, there was an argument that says this will save energy, like daylight saving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Actually, the Industrial Research Institute, the IRI, did a simulation and said it will save energy, but at 0.0000014 percent, so not really worth it. There’s people saying it will increase tourism. The minister of labor said it will not increase tourism unless you break labor laws by essentially everybody working one hour more, and things like that.

                    <p>
                        Every argument was met with a fact-based response from each ministry, and then we invite both sides into the same table. Then it turns out it’s about China.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The side with +9 said what they want to do is that they want to force people who travel from Beijing or Shanghai to Taipei to adjust their watch and their phone by one hour in a show of different jurisdiction. The people on the other side correctly points out, first, smartwatches and phones auto-adjust. People will not actually become aware of it. [laughs]

                        The second is that we will make, maybe, international news for 15 minutes, but only as a laughing stock, but then people forget about it and we have to pay the same recurring cost. The PRC would say, “One country, two systems. Many country with different time zones. Hong Kong has its own currency.” It really doesn’t change. [laughs] The main narrative is not effective.

                    <p>
                        If you look into the original petition and the mind map that we made of it, one of the interesting thing is that the people with different guidelines of how to talk about these things – this is the map [laughs] – eventually agreed, after they get their feelings checked with each other first, whether a change in time zone can actually make Taiwan more visible. People is like, “Not in a good way.”

                        Finally, we start brainstorming is there any way to spend a similar amount of money, but in a much more effective way that both sides, those who want to identify more PRC and those who don’t, can nevertheless agree on.

                        Again, I didn’t quite answer that question, because this is mostly about letting people understand that we’re a polity, after all. We’re, as I like to say it, a republic of citizens, or 民國. That reflects into this agenda setting, instead of wasting time on the one or two ideological issues.

                        These technologies can be used even within the Great Firewall. That is, indeed, what students in the China Academy of Arts learned about, the people in Hangzhou, so they can run it locally.

                        At that time, which is three years ago, the PRC is somewhat OK with the local level governance or universities to run small experiments, but you can’t call it civic participation. You have to call it social innovators or social entrepreneurship.

                        In any case, with the right brand name you can still do that, but nowadays, in the past year, it’s becoming more and more difficult. Unless the very basic strata that is the freedom of speech and assembly is established, I don’t think it’s very useful to layer more on top. Maybe we should work on the underlying layer first.

                        Do you have any kind of regulation on which statements can be made? Because everyone can create a statement that is to be disagreed or agreed upon. I can imagine that in Germany we would have a lot of very extremist statements. Do you regulate those?

                        No. Basically, it has to be on topic. If we are talking how to make Taiwan more globally visible, then proposing time zone change is fine, but proposing something which is utterly unrelated is not.

                        Other than relevance we don’t do much moderation. The reason is that people need to see that extreme comments tend to get only a fringe of support. They can see their position, their avatar literally moving to the fringe, away from the people. That is important to show that extreme views are actually extreme and most people are in the middle.

                        Yes. Sorry. Where they acknowledged officially. Some of these countries are countries in which human rights are not really recognized. How do you, personally, feel about the ROC relying on these countries for – I don’t know how to say that – approval or for validation in the international context?

                        Our diplomatic focus has changed quite a bit after the rolling out of the sustainable development goals. This presentation here is what I shared in Addis Ababa, which is not a ROC-asserting place. There’s a lot of input from the PRC to build their infrastructure.

                        The ideas that I shared, which is about reverse mentorship like each ministry in a social innovation plan, all 12 of them, appoint to young social entrepreneurs as reverse mentors to the minister about this common platform of social innovation in Taiwan to identify the SDGs, the office hour in town halls that I just shared with you.

                        The Presidential Hackathon, this is a Honduras team but also the other winner was a Malaysian team. All shows the same idea, which is “Taiwan Can Help.”

                    <p>
                        We’re not asking, say, the Malaysia team to recognize that Taiwan government somehow represents the entirety of China, which is a difficult statement to say even to me. Now all you have to acknowledge is which sustainable goals that you’re working on. For example, the Malaysian team was around SDG16, they want to build a system that identified from the open procurement data, cartels. So anti-corruption. It’s not quite human right, but it’s anti-corruption.

                    <p>
                        As long as they agree with us on that particular SDG, which is SDG16, then we can share because in Taiwan we open up the entire procurement data. Not just the finalized, but also the initial bits to researchers, completely raw data, and very few jurisdictions do that.

                        I think only Greece does that for obvious reasons, [laughs] because of international demand. Taiwan does this voluntarily, and so because of that, we have a lot to share.

                    <p>
                        My point is that we’re not saying that Malaysia having to officially recognize ROC, but they can still get our Presidential Hackathon award, and we’re not saying that they have to first pass some value check, as long as they want to improve on any of the SDGs, we’re happy to send a team and co-work with them to solve their issues.

                    <p>
                        That’s the very balanced approach, and especially because SDGs are affirmed by all the governments, including the PRC. When I sent my robotic double to share about the SDGs in the Geneva UN building in the Internet Governance Forum, the PRC really couldn’t shout me down, because first they have also agreed on SDGs, was talking about, I think 9, so this one, SDG9.c, I think it’s universal Internet access and infrastructure.

                    <p>
                        It’s not like that they can shut this down. When I shared that, they did a kind of token protest, but they really couldn’t exclude this conversation from happening. That’s my consistent strategy also in engaging with UNSDSN and UN-ESCAP, UN-Habitat, and so on.

                        Even though the person in the flesh sometime need an invitation later to get into the UNCC-AA building in Ethiopia, we can always send robotic doubles which doesn’t need passports, and what I said through the robots is also on official UN public record. It’s just a digital innovation toward SDGs.

                        As soon as we stray of the SDGs, then it becomes political, it’s not policy anymore; so we stay firmly within this policy area, SDGs, that’s what we’ve been constantly doing for the past three years.

                        Yeah, in the cryptocurrency industry. I would like to learn is there an official strategy and what does Taiwan make such a big player, and what is the acceptance of the population? Do you follow a strategy to encourage people to trade on cryptocurrencies, or is it more like a phenomenon of a few people?

                        It’s a deliberate strategy. The v-Taiwan platform which pioneered the use of polis for Uber, Airbnb and so on, at that time when we first run this consultations in 2015, after Uber and Airbnb, the topmost interest was in Bitcoin.

                        In 2016 when I first became Digital Minister, actually before I became Digital Minster, while I was still the understudy, we did the initial consultation on what we call the FinTech sandbox, which is a UK idea. Singapore also implemented it.

                    <p>
                        We extended it to a general-purpose sandbox. Very simply put, sandbox or GTW collects anything that innovators want to clarify whether it’s legal or not, whether it’s a legal gray area, or they think the regulations should be changed to their favor. They usually have to provide a fork, that is to say an alternate version of regulation. FinTech, Crypto is of course part of it.

                    <p>
                        We just matchmake them with the jurisdictions like municipalities and so on, or primary banks, or primary telco operators that can write a business proposal. For self-driving vehicles, which the sandbox goes online this month, with the vehicles.

                        It could be a car that flies, or s hip that also drives, it’s not pertaining to a specific way of vehicle. Then everybody gets one year of sandbox. The one year means that the law will work in your version in that area.

                    <p>
                        For FinTech, for example, people want to use mobile banking, or want to use blockchains to do international wiring without going into the SWIFT system, or things like that. They have to prove to the regulators that they can take care of themselves, that the risk factor is actually lower not higher than the traditional KYC mechanism, so they’re given a year.

                    <p>
                        Then within a year, they have to enroll like 5,000 people or so on, and to show everybody that this is a better way of doing things. If after a year, people think it’s a bad idea, or something very bad happens, then we thank the investors, everybody learns something, it’s open data.

                        People learn to do something in some way else, but if after a year people think it’s a great idea, and then we have a good risk calculation done, then it become the regulation.

                        Within your FinTech sandbox proposal, you can also challenge the Ministry of Economy, challenge the Ministry of Interior and so on. The only two things that you cannot challenge is money laundering and funding terrorism, because we know these are not good, we don’t have to experiment. Other money laundering and funding terrorism, everything is fair game.

                        You can challenge any regulation of any ministry. After four years, at most, if the MPs take an interest, so at a regulatory level it’s one year, at most two. If the MP feel we have to make a special law about it, then they can deliberate three years if it’s FinTech, four years if it’s self-driving, like three to four years.

                        During their deliberation to a new law, this original proof of concept and proof of business is still running, and everybody else was still illegal. Basically, we were given up to a four years monopoly to try your idea.

                        While the MPs figure out how to regulate, and once they regulate, like there was a STO regulation that was just passed last month, then of course everybody become legal, because then we’re just saying crypto tokens is a way for equity-based crowdfunding to run, and that’s the way it is, is equity-based crowdfunding.

                        You use existing laws on equity-based crowdfunding with some provision on the token-based mechanism of record. That took some time. During that, if there’s a sandbox happening, that can continue to run so that incentivizes disruptive innovators to become less disruptive by actually talking to a society and convince 5,000 people it’s a good idea.

                        I was actually invited to a comment on the German AI white paper, and I think my comment is basically that there’s a focus of AI as an industrial innovation driver, and all the language that we hear is of industry, and I think there is a kind of categorical mismatch here.

                    <p>
                        It’s similar to like how we say human resource, but we say incentivizing corporations, encouraging corporations. It’s weird because encouragement is to a human being, or at least a dog or something, but resource, again, is material. By putting human as resource, but incentivizing, encouraging corporations, is a twist of category.

                        I think making social innovation dependent on industrial innovation, in the narrative, I think creates a kind of perversion of categories. If we say social innovation is by itself useful, that distributed ledger, by itself, creates trust making new governance possible without having any GDP contributions. I think that is a much more balanced view.

                        I’m not saying industrial innovation or GDP is bad. I’m just saying that if we think long-term, like 10 years, 20 years, and so on, those what we call patient fund, or impact investment, or things like that, that GDP alignment, if long-term enough, will tend to agree with the social one, and will actually work with the social and environmental one to set the agenda.

                        If we’re only looking at the next quarter on automation, then we will focus naturally on how much people work to be replaced, but that creates an unnecessary division between the workers and the capitalists. I think a common long-term planning based on what to empower, and also what to automate, and what people are enjoying doing, shouldn’t be automated.
