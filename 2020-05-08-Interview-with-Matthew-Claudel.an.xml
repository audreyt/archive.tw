                    2020-05-08 Interview with Matthew Claudel

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        I really am grateful that you’re here and willing to take the time to talk. It’s really an honor for me to include you in this special issue of “The Site Magazine.” I know a bit about your work from the Network of Regulatory Experimentation and Indy Johar and that connection.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I immediately thought of you for this issue because we’re looking at this particular moment and trying to think about, on the one hand, the things that are emerging, what’s new and what people are doing in response and the ways in which the crisis is causing people to innovate and do things in new ways…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        Also, some of those things that are potentially worrisome and that are changing and the ways that we don’t have government systems in place, governance systems in place, to be thinking about some of the kinds of digital technology, medical technology, or even political responses that are being pursued.

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        That’s what we’re doing with this special issue. We have people talking about food systems. We have people talking about bottom-up community response. We have people talking about local government, surveillance technology, everything.

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        It’s a great group. I’m excited to include some of the work that you’ve been doing, that you published on the blogs, but also flesh that out with our conversation here. Thank you.

                    <p>
                        Yeah, sure. Let’s get started.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        I have a handful of questions for you. Just to make sure, do you have half an hour or an hour? What’s the time frame?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We have roughly 40 minutes, but I’m flexible. If we end up taking 50, it’s fine.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        Cool. If you could just start out by introducing me to your office, the digital office, and in ordinary circumstances what your agenda is or what the mission of the office is.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Taiwan is in a ordinary circumstance. We’ve never declared emergency. There’s been zero lockdowns. There’s, unfortunately, six people who succumbed to the coronavirus, but six people is not that much by international standards, by far.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Today, our professional baseball league will have a thousand people participating in the audience. We’ve never had to close schools and so on. First, let me say we’re under normal circumstances. This is my office, literally my office.

                        It’s a Social Innovation Lab. Next week, we will be done tearing up all the walls around the office. It becomes a park. Anybody and their dog can walk in and enjoy the vicinity.

                        The Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab is home to many artists as well as social innovators that tries to communicate how important it is for people to get together to innovate for the public good. That is social innovation.

                    <p>
                        My office’s role – I’m officially the Digital Minister in charge of Social Innovation, Open Government, and Youth Engagement – is to make sure that the best ideas, the brightest ideas, are amplified throughout our network of many social innovation units around Taiwan so that, for example, when people in Tainan thinks, “Oh, it may be a good idea to visualize the pharmacies’ mask distribution.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Then we make sure that all the pharmacies in Taiwan publish their stock level of a medical mask every 30 seconds at a time. Now it’s every three minutes because nobody queues to buy mask anymore.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        In any case, this real-time participatory ledger enabled everybody to take part in the governance. Instead of trusting the government to make good use of public resources, the government instead trusts the civil society, trusts the entire society to make good use of the shared common data.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        So that they can form the data coalition, data collaboratives, that makes the analysis, that makes the best decisions and share those decisions, and also take care of people with blindness who cannot view a map into voice assistance, into chat bots, and things like that.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The main idea is that we should support but not control anything that is a data collaborative by the civil society. We run annual Presidential Hackathon, where the top five social innovation teams get a trophy from our President, Tsai Ing-wen, now in her second term in a couple weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The trophy is a micro projector. If you turn on, it projects the image of a president handing you the trophy, promising whatever…

                    <p>
                        …you did in the past three months will become national policy in the next 12 months. We do shorter hackathons as well, like the cohack.tw, which is specifically around coronavirus mitigation and transitioning to a post-coronavirus world.

                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Again, we use technology such as Polis, that clusters people’s shared reflections and opinion so we can listen at scale without being swamped by people who AstroTurf or by trolls or things like that. It’s basically a troll-proof way to get people’s rough consensus on any divisive or potentially divisive issues. That’s another thing that we do.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We also respond to the e-petitions. Whenever, wherever people – that includes residents of foreign nationality and people under 18 years old – think of a great idea and mobilize 5,000 people to support them, such as banning plastic straws in the take-out of the national identity drink, the bubble tea.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We make sure that we have a ministerial point-by-point response and a face-to-face collaborative meeting that take care of all the stakeholders, including the makers of such one-use utensils to make sure that everybody can transition into circular design and so on. I haven’t mentioned the reverse mentors yet, but that is the basic idea of this portfolio.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        What you’re talking about, you said support but not control. There is something really interesting. There’s a nuance. Of course, you’re not controlling, but you also have the credibility with the pharmacies that when you turn around and say, “Look, we need you to open the data,” it’s not that your mandating. I want to understand this dynamic. It’s not that you’re mandating.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course. They can stay out of it, but they see that if people go to their pharmacy, they get now, if you’re adult, 9 mask every two weeks or if you’re a child, 10 mask every two weeks.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s much more instant gratification if instead of waiting until the end of day to see the statistics, which most citizens never do anyway, after a couple minutes you just refresh your phone and see the stock level deplete by 9 or 10.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This is participatory accountability that establish trust directly between the pharmacies and the customers instead of through the legitimacy of a government. They are also enjoying a stake in it. They’re national heroes now anyway.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Basically, they get more instant gratification for the feedback that they receive from the citizens, as well as because they are stakeholders in the system, they can suggest new improvements.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We did implement all of that into the data schema that includes, for example, their opening hours, the time that they prefer to hand out numbered cards in exchange for the shorter queue and things like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        All of that makes sure that their design is also part of the national system, making this again a co-creation. It’s not something that we mandate for the pharmacies. They’re also designers.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        I’m curious. Obviously, this, the coronavirus, has given you a very specific set of very clear challenges that your office is very well-suited. The structure and the accountability networks that you have and the digital capacities you have, perhaps, are very well-structured to deal with this particular crisis. I’m curious how this moment feels different than the work that you do ordinarily.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The main difference is that the time scale of the crisis is the same or almost the same across the globe. Previously, when we worked on climate change mitigation, for example through our civil IoT network, we work with people who crowdsource their environmental data, measuring air quality, now water quality, and things like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It doesn’t have the same sense of urgency when you compare it to the smaller Pacific islands who will suffer the consequence of climate change within one generation. In Taiwan, we maybe suffer in two or three generations.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If you’re a larger, more continental territory, then you suffer it maybe four generations down the road. The timescale is very different between all the different people working on it. That has been the main challenge of working on climate change mitigation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        However, the coronavirus shortened this generational gap into a kind of week gap. [laughs] Take any two jurisdictions, they’re only weeks apart when comparing their situation between two epicenters, and so that expanded our international horizon massively.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        My slides, for example, the fast, fair, fun principle at dealing with the coronavirus using social innovation, now has a global reach that the African countries, the Latin American countries, and so on, basically wherever the epicenters go, this bilateral conversation between two epicenters become like almost immediate.

                    <p>
                        I don’t have to explain the climate science to the other side. Neither do the climate scientists have to explain the urgency to me.

                <speech by="#Matthew Claudel">
                    <p>
                        I find that interesting, actually, that now that Taiwan is very plugged into a global knowledge base around this, and that you get this real-time flow of information in a way that hasn’t been as relevant before.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        I’m curious, has that been a two-way exchange of information? What are you learning from other places?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Definitely. First of all, I’d like to share this website, which is social innovation. It’s not done by our government. It’s by a bunch of YouTubers, and with all due respect. Taiwancanhelp.us is a timeline of how Taiwan has been dealing with the pandemic, and if you scroll down a little bit, you’ll see a crash course.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This is very important because it’s done by literally the person who wrote the epidemiology textbook still used in universities, but Chen Chien-jen, academician, is also our vice president. [laughs]

                        It’s very interesting how he is able to then work with professional communicators, to take cutting-edge science and turn it into very easy to access courses that are currently being translated into multiple languages.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course, that includes the latest developments of the international scientific community. There’s no way that Taiwan could have done this alone around rapid testing, around vaccination, and around pharmaceutical research.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We also learned from the digital part from, for example, Tokyo, who has offered a real-time dashboard of easy communication web page that everybody can look and see how exactly things are going on around Tokyo, and in Tokyo.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">

                        The great thing is that the entire proposal is done by their civil society, the Code for Japan. It’s all open source. I personally contributed on GitHub to take this dashboard and change the language selector of the Taiwan version of it.

                        Sure. In Taiwan, we say digital competence. We don’t say literacy. It’s a conscious choice because in Mandarin, literacy or 識讀 assume that you’re a consumer or a viewer, reader of information, whereas competence 素養 means that you’re a producer, a creator, a steward of information, and data, and media.

                        I showed this prototype, which only lived for a couple of days, to our premier, our prime minister, the very next Monday, and say, “Look, if we can get accurate data in pharmacies, then this would actually save the mental health of our entire population.

If you see a pharmacy that is further, but it’s green, it means that you should take it despite it being further away.”

                        That was actually one of my questions, was that it seems like a big sort of asset that Taiwan has had was the recent learning from SARS, and the fact that you went through this and you developed some knowledge from that.

                        I’m curious. First off, what did you learn from SARS and now you’re taking into the COVID situation? Also, knowing that you were able to learn from that, what are you taking forward into the next, into the future, from COVID? What are the provisions you’re packing from this moment?

                    <p>
                        From SARS, we learned three important things, and that’s fair and fun. [laughs] First is obvious, because we don’t have a easy to cross border. We’re a bunch of islands. It’s impossible to accidentally stumble upon Taiwan.

                        If you do testing and quarantining at the borders, you don’t have to do Bluetooth tracing apps at any kind. We’re not rolling that out. If you do the quarantine well at the borders, test well at the borders, act early, like when Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower post that there’s new SARS in Wuhan around the end of December.

                    <p>
                        We received that from the social media signals at the last day of December. The very next day, the first day of 2020, we start doing health inspection for flights from Wuhan to Taiwan, and 10 days afterward, WHO would still be saying, “No, you shouldn’t do that. People from Wuhan is OK. There’s no clear evidence of human to human transmission,” and so on.

                    <p>
                        Basically, by having this SARS inoculation of society, we take the measures as if SARS has happened over again, because nobody know what this SARS-CoV-2 is like at that point, and we enacted these inspections and soon quarantining at the borders.

                        This fast response I think is really important, also with the hotline. Everybody can call 1922 and get their ideas at tips across to the CECC, to the Central Epidemic Command Center. That’s the first lesson we learned from SARS.

                    <p>
                        The second lesson we learned is that mask is essential. In Taiwan, mask is very interestingly billed as something that protects the wearer, especially medical mask, because, A, it reminds people not to touch their mouth. B, it reminds people of proper hand sanitation rules, and so it’s protective.

                        Of course all of us know it primarily protect other people, but it lead to an interesting social situation where, even in a crowd of people of 20, even if only 2 people wear a medical mask, they can gently remind the other 18 people to take care of their own health by putting their mask on.

                        It’s a very interesting incentive design that is very well-ingrained in Taiwan, and not only in Taiwan, but also Hong Kong and so on, during the SARS epidemic, and so that norm is been reinvoked in the coronavirus.

                        Finally, communication is essential. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, we’ve already doing this humor over rumor way to counter disinformation with very fun, memetic pictures that make sure that joys travels quicker than outrage online.

                        It is really the only effective way that we found to counter disinformation, of course armed with real data, and journalism, and fact-checking, and so on. The payload still need to be journalistic, but the fact-checking need to be fun and memetic.

We give out lots and lots of medical mask, but if you choose another website, which is taiwancanhelp.com.tw, I’ll share the link with you, you will see that those medical mask that we donate to the world is actually dedicated by a lot of people.

                    <p>
                        When the recipient of the medical mask receives our gift, they can see that these mask are not the gift from the government of Taiwan only, but rather from the people of Taiwan, and not an abstract people of Taiwan, but exactly 500,000 people where you can look up your name on. This gives this international collaboration a publicly approved mandate.

                        We don’t need 100 percent. As I said, there’s people who did not participate in this, but there’s a lot of people who basically dedicated their uncollected mask quota, starting from the point where everybody is guaranteed to have three mask per week, to now.

                        Yeah, and it’s politically different. I’m curious how you see, given any kind of help of the kind that you’re already seeing with some of the digital things, or some of the responses, or whatever might emerge in the future.

                        First of all, that’s why I mentioned epicenter to epicenter communication. Taiwan is twice bigger than New Jersey, so it’s not like a city state. You wouldn’t say New Jersey is a half city state. [laughs] In any case, what I’m trying to get at is that if we begin with a mindset that says as long as anybody can share…

                    <p>
                        I said that Taiwan is about twice bigger than New Jersey, and so you wouldn’t call New Jersey a half city state, or maybe you would. [laughs] The point I’m making is that what we’re offering is a culture of open innovation. That’s why I mentioned the good example of our collaboration with Tokyo.

                        In Amsterdam, actually, there’s this mayor city office, and they do a lot of their development in the open. Our own website for not only the masks are from the civil society, but our own website for the revitalization plan, the directory, and so on, these are all open source. They’re developed on GitHub.

                    <p>
                        What I’m trying to say is that maybe it’s a good opportunity for us to look past the traditional jurisdiction-based multilateral point of view. It’s much more useful if we just compare one epicenter to another and see how they resemble each other, and only on the paths of where they resemble each other.

                        For example, the Czech Republic use a lot of playbook of the interesting incentive design that I just mentioned around mask use. They did a very successful, fun digital communication campaign that basically changed the norm around mask use over the course of a week.

                        That’s something, the mask for all campaign, that the Taiwan digital communicators can get behind, and provide scientific evidence that you can revitalize the mask, for example, using rice cookers. [laughs]

                        In any case, what I’m trying to say is that if then the measure that the #MaskForAll unites people who are in similar stages, then we can collaborate on that particular subject with all the subject matter experts.

                        That’s why Pol.is, the technology, you’ll find such focus among a swathe of social innovations, is so important in Cohack and similar setups, because otherwise, more people joining actually detracts from the problem-solving, because people have to use their mental bandwidth to look through all the ideas.

                        For people to cross-moderate each other and then find commonalities between two very different epicenters as one or two things – actually, no, it’s seven things or so – to focus on, that is very useful. That’s, again, how digital deliberative technologies can help to unite the research focus of all the resources into epicenters, and we look forward to do them all.

[laughs] If you have any good ideas around any of the 16 Millennium Goals, and think how open contracting can help solving it, then the International Track of the Presidential Hackathon is exactly what you’re looking at.

                        Or if they talk to other endeavors, they can say, “No, Taiwan has a very good social sector-led model. I would like to use your resource this way, and it’s been proven that it’s more effective than the traditional PPP model that you’re suggesting,” and maybe the World Bank learns a thing or two.

                        Yes. I think the government should fully trust the citizens. When we say mutual trust, all too often, people think it’s the people should trust the government, which will lead to people trusting each other.

                        It really is a city state with Confucian thought, and we’re happy with our relationship with Singapore, but Taiwan is not that. [laughs] Taiwan is far more Daoist, or Austronesian, or Pacific Island than traditional collectivist thought.

                        A lot of Taiwan’s design comes from the idea that the social sector had years and decades to build legitimacy. The president only had comparatively a small number of time, because we first get the direct presidential election in 1996, after the World Wide Web.

                        Not only digital and democracy is the same thing in Taiwan, the same generation of people working on it, but also often need to respect the social sector legitimacy that’s already very well-established before even the modern liberal democratic system.

                        That, I think, is part of the underpinning of why we always say we cannot beat the social sector. We must join the social sector. We cannot control the social sector. We must support the social sector. Even in the language choice, we never say the third sector because they’re the primary sector.

                        I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to constitute a public. This is on my desk right now, but John Dewey’s “The public and It’s Problems” is from almost 100 years ago, but he’s talking about when people have a shared problem or a mutual goal, they come together and they become a public.

                        Only if a government is necessary does the government then become a function of that public, but what’s really happening is this public format. I just find that compelling, and it sounds like that’s exactly what you’re doing in this approach. It’s like government’s there, but it’s really the process of this public formulation that’s at the heart of it.

                        That’s right. As a concluding thought, I’ll share with you a write-up from Medium, from Jon Edward Alexander with the title, “The Nation You’re Not Allowed to Learn From,” that sums up some of these ideas with a citizen republic lens that you’ve been describing.
