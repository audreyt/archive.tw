                    <p>
                        Yngve, would you like to start?

                    <p>
                        Me? Yeah. Good morning, you. Good morning. I’m an artist. I primarily work with sculpture, and it’s different materials. It could be very classical, and then glass, metalwork, to using ready-made for medical industry, airplane industry. It’s different from time to time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        It used to be, I would say, that when I came out of school more…I tried to be more conceptually or I tried to get more information into my sculpture, I guess sometimes more than I thought was possible for the viewer to read.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        There was a split in my production, where I decided that I want to act purely on form, or it appears to be a conversation piece, and be able to kick start many conversations, and not just the illustration, and that one dimensional reading off a topic. I started publishing research in terms of texts. I started doing interviews with people when I was interested.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        It’s often industry-related, but I’m interested in. It started off with an interview, where I was just interested in aviation at the time. I was wondering how it was to be a pilot. We got the pilot. There was an anonymous interview with the pilot, and so he could say certain things about his airline that he maybe couldn’t say if he would say it under his company name.

                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        That became the pilot issue, and it went into a series of publications relating to adult industry, entertainment industry, plastic surgery, and then I went into the rainforest, and food production.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        Different topics that interested me. They were printed publications, question-answer, anonymized, not to protect people, but more the thing that you could have a high and low.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        Again, the last one was about brand. If you would speak with a very famous neuroscientist in Germany, he would already have done 50 interviews, so you just get the same interview that we had done for the last magazine. If you would maybe speak with a younger researcher who’s not a public persona, sometimes, the language and the way of speaking about the field was just more interesting.

                    <p>
                        If you then anonymized it, it wouldn’t be like this, read who is famous, don’t read who is not famous. You get more like a…

                    <p>
                        How many of those interview topics have you done, or what were the interview topics that you’ve…

                    <p>
                        They take time. The first one was the aviation one. It’s called ETOPS, and it’s a certification for a twin jet, a two-motor airline plane, and how long it’s allowed to fly. It was a certification that started when…

                <speech by="#Yngve Holen">
                    <p>
                        It means extended operations, and that was just the idea. How far can you go with the topic before it falls apart as a metaphor? That’s the pilot issue, which is more pictures. It has the Q&#x26;R with the pilot in the back, which I thought was really cool.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then there was one on the LA porn industry, but also on the plastic surgery industry, unrelated. It’s like somehow a magazine about being young, trading your body for money, or being old, trading your money to become younger kind of trajectory.

                        LA, then there’s one where we went to Brazil and to Peru. It’s about rainforest, but it’s also about tasting menu, a la Chef’s Table, where reinventing national cuisine through food. Biodiversity of monoculture somehow is the…but they’re all, it’s all text savvy, full-on interviews.

                    <p>
                        They’re all 12 interviews a piece. Then there’s the last one – we cut the format, so it’s a little bit more like “Pulp Fiction” – which is called ETOPS Headache, and it’s about neuroscience. It’s 2020, so it’s…These are the magazines, basically.

                    <p>
                        Thank you. Minister Tang, any questions, or shall I hand it over to you?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No, not too much, but by making this an online-only medium, we’re going to talk about most of the audience using two-dimensional screens. How navigable is it? Are we looking at mostly a web-based presentation?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        To explore an interactive space through web, it’s possible, of course. There’s WebVR, WebXR, and things like that, but are we looking at these kind of more pretending there’s a solid in your room interactions, or are we just looking at a more flat imagination, like two-dimensional video of a pre-oriented object?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        I think the event itself is pretty much anticipated to be video-based, but we’d be open to other kinds of experimentation, if you were both excited about something along those lines. I think I guess you were picking up on the fact that Yngve is a sculptor.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        I suppose that, because our brief is so open-ended, yes, I can imagine there could be something three-dimensional that’s produced. I think it also could be, the way that seven-on-seven conversations go, it also could be that what gets produced is a website or something that is a little bit different in format than Yngve’s usual practice, especially because there’s not a huge amount of time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        I think that one of the things that Yngve’s work often involves is a lot of industrial process, which I think we probably wouldn’t want to get into.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        I think maybe there are other ways of bringing that in. I guess my answer is we’re open to anything, but the primary default format is video. I didn’t necessarily think you were to here to make a 3D object.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        Making a 3D model could be an interesting prompt for Yngve, but there could be many other approaches to this.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The closest I have personally worked with sculpture is Tilt Brush. It’s a virtual reality application where you essentially sculpt in VR. Through video only, it’s hard to explore a Tilt Brush object.

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If you were not looking for that, then maybe I will just drop this whole virtual reality thing. I am personally doing a lot of my work in virtual reality and around virtual reality, but it does require specific interaction modes.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        For example, like in Taiwan, we are currently having this very affordable headset called XR Space that’s very light. You can wear it for three or four hours. The resolution is pretty good. There’s no controller. You just control it using your hands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Basically, you use this built-in scanner with 5G connection. It can scan your entire room into a virtual room. Also, you, of course, as a double avatar. It cuts a lot of the modeling steps that’s usually associated, like photogrammetry, videogrammetry, etc.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I understand if the time is limited, and most of the viewers are not going to be interacting through interactive viewers, anyway, then there’s no point in even considering extended reality. That’s fine. I’m just here to ensure the perimeter of our collaboration.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Michael Connor">
                    <p>
                        That does seem very interesting, but maybe if you could take a step back for a moment and just get in your own words a brief introduction and where you are in your practice at this moment, which I know is a long and complicated trajectory now. [laughs]

                    <p>
                        No, it’s not very complicated. I’m a poetician. I mostly write poems and inspiring prayers. I’m a lowercase minister. It means I preach, I guess, about a digital transformation, sustainability, inclusive innovation, this sort.

                    <p>
                        I recently had a few long conversations, one with Yuval Harari, the historian, about why I’m optimistic as much as he is pessimistic about assistive intelligence and stuff.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This conversation, which I posted here, covers most of the motif that my own poetic work is based on. Previously, I also had a long conversation – actually, two – with Paul B. Preciado around queer in the politics, I guess.

                        As a genderqueer, the first openly transgender cabinet member in the world, I believe, there is also a lot of interesting conversations around nonbinary thinking and how to take it into politics. I would say non-duality is the main idea that I am working in Taiwan.

                        This includes the duality between the government and the people. I am at this La Grange Point between the movements on one side and government and the other, and working on things like counter-COVID.

                        We’re officially post-pandemic for quite a few months now, which works really well, because there’s whole-sector mobilization on the sort of innovations. It’s just poetic work, really, but it seems to really get into the current zeitgeist of people wanting to feel much closer together.

                        It’s not printed, because it’s a slow process. It’s something where it’s like, I don’t know how many people read them, either, but it’s there. If it will be online, that kind of format, I think it wouldn’t work in the same often.

                        I often thought about, would it work online? As a printed, 100 pages manuscript, where you could dive into it, it’s accessible, but it’s not like…I never figured out. We deliberately didn’t go online with it and thought about a slow distribution and doing topics that are lasting.

                        Also, I guess I should say, two things. First of all. When is that? Although the event is online, the project itself doesn’t have to live online. One of the things to know is that there’s a lot of uncertainty because of COVID, but we are planning to have an exhibition early next year.

                        There is some potential to create work for a gallery context and have video portion of seven-on-seven be a conversation about a project. That’s one way to approach. Even if the Consultavanger exhibition didn’t happen, that would still be a valid way to approach.

                        I think that we should look at the web as a possibility but not as a limitation. I wanted to say that, when I bring pairs together, because I know this…Especially since we have limited time together, there’s a desire to find concrete ideas.

                        Of course, by suggesting ETOPS, I am myself falling into that. The way that I’d describe these collaborations often is through a story about the artist, David Hammons, a famous artist from first LA and then New York that makes a lot of interesting conceptual work.

                        In the ‘80s, he would set up a project in Washington Square Park where he would make snowballs and sell the snowballs during winter storms. One time in an interview, someone asked him, “Why do you make these snowballs? Why don’t you just sit there…”

                        “Look, if the point is to have conversations, why don’t you just sit there and talk to people?” David Hammons said, “Well, if you’re just a person on the street, people don’t know how to interact. If you have an object between you, the object allows a kind of conversation to happen.”

                        I like to think of the prompt for seven-on-seven as being to make snowballs. It’s not necessarily a highly-crafted object, but it allows a conversation to happen that wouldn’t happen otherwise. I think let’s focus maybe, I was a bit of a miss…

                        Rather than focusing on ETOPS or a format, you mentioned the poems are interesting, Yngve. I wonder, I guess the other thing that jumps out from your conversation is just thinking about industrial process as an aspect of your work.

                        You incidentally also have a lot of interesting portrait-ish photo that seems to go well with the ETOPS format. Almost if we want to minimize our work, we can just simply write a simple program, and then for Holen to curate the format and me the content, and maybe work with some assistive intelligence folks. We just generate, I don’t know, 500,000 issues of ETOPS-like literature. [laughs] Build your own ETOPS with those seeded text and photography.

That would involve an on-camera interview as well as, potentially, some sort of archival material that we bring together shown in previous projects.

                        It’s something we can have a New York-based person named Lauren Siegel, that would direct all of that. We’ve worked with Lauren quite a while. Very good for taking on board artists’ concerns or technologists’ concerns or shaping things a certain way.

                        Then it would move into a live presentation of the project. You’re quite right that the online format does skew it a bit, but I would introduce each of you. Then the two of you would share the project and have an open-ended discussion.

                        As I mentioned, if there’s a way to break the format, we would be open to it always. The main thing is you’ll have a 30-minute window and a mixture of pre-recorded and live material, including some time for discussion with myself as moderator.

                        I’m getting really into this idea of using, how you say…I have to go look into it, how would these websites work or how you’re text recording of any interview that you do. It’s amazing. I don’t know how to say it. [laughs] I like the good idea. It’s something cool there that interests me in relation to how to mint something digitally.

                        Is there anything that you want me to send in terms of physical content? Do you want me to send some books of the magazines for this project? I could just wrap it up and send it your way. Is that of interest?

                    <p>
                        Yeah. Of course, that would help, but what I’m looking at more is some sketches of your imagination of the format. If you would like to say, “Oh, this is exactly the same as this,” then, of course, that would help.

                    <p>
                        If it’s like, “Please draw inspiration from this,” then that helps less. If we have the style and the content decoupled a little bit at the beginning, then I would just work with the style, the format that you settle on, instead of being part of this style or formatting work.
